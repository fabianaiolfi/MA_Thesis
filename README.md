## Research Proposal

**To Do**
- [ ] Abstract
- [ ] Conclusion
- [x] Deal with multiple sources in one parathenses; multiple sources in parentheses still include `p. `
- [ ] Figures
	- [x] Title in caption
	- [x] Place all figures at top of page
	- [x] Map
		- [x] Add caption
		- [x] Smaller?
	- [ ] International Emigration and EU Accession
		- [x] Y-axis label correct?
		- [x] Place sources in footnote? → If yes, then remove appendix
		- [ ] Make country names bigger
	- [ ] Correlation Plot
		- [x] Add title to caption
		- [ ] Plot labels larger
		- [x] Insert newlines in caption?
- [x] Add number to Dancygier causal mechanism
- [x] Latex-ify updated chain of events (p. 7)
- [x] Latex-ify empirical specification
- [x] Spell check
- [ ] Clean up References
- [x] Remove contractions
- [x] Check if double line spacing is working
- [ ] Check that links work / don’t go off page (see FT article in References)
- [x] Check all references to figures and formulas

- [ ] Preliminary Explorations
	- [x] NUTS3 emigration map
	- [x] Model emigration and vote switching
	- [x] International emigration rate before and after EU accession
	- [x] Measure grievances through ESS5 and ESS9: How happy are you? → correlation between happiness and emigration → are people from emigration-high regions generally unhappier? → 10_grievances_emigration
	- [ ] Is there demographic change in emigration hit regions? Are there less younger and more older people? Does this correlate with less schools and less hospitals?
	- [ ] Grievances and vote switching: Is there a correlation between the two in general, and more so in the actual regions that are hit by emigration? → might be difficult because EES does not ask about happiness → combine EES and ESS?; or maybe Q20 “And over the next 12 months, how do you think the general economic situation in Ireland will be?”

## Preliminary Explorations
- 05_incumbent_vote_share: Is there a correlation between NUTS3 international emigration and vote share of the incumbent party?
- 06_age_demographics: Create plot showing below 15y/o and over 65y/o population number in CEE
- 07_schools_emigration: Model correlation between number of schools and net migration
- 08_hospital_beds_emigration: Model correlation between number of hospital beds and net migration
- 09_third_places_emigration: Model correlation between number of third places and net migration
- 10_grievances_emigration: Model correlation between happiness and net migration
