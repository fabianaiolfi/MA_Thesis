## Research Proposal

**To Do**
- [ ] Abstract
- [ ] Conclusion
- [ ] Sources
	- [ ] Deal with multiple sources in one parathenses; multiple sources in parentheses still include `p. `
- [ ] Figures
	- [ ] Title in caption?
	- [ ] Place all figures at top of page
	- [ ] Map
		- [ ] Add caption
		- [ ] Smaller?
	- [ ] International Emigration and EU Accession
		- [ ] Y-axis label correct?
		- [ ] Place sources in footnote? → If yes, then remove appendix
		- [ ] Make country names bigger
	- [ ] Correlation Plot
		- [ ] Add title to caption
		- [ ] Plot labels larger
		- [ ] Insert newlines in caption?
- [ ] Add number to Dancygier causal mechanism
- [ ] Latex-ify updated chain of events (p. 7)
- [ ] Latex-ify empirical specification
- [ ] Spell check
- [ ] Clean up References
- [ ] Remove contractions
- [ ] Check if double line spacing is working
- [ ] Check that links work / don’t go off page (see FT article in References)
- [ ] Check all references to figures and formulas

- [ ] Preliminary Explorations
	- [x] NUTS3 emigration map
	- [x] Model emigration and vote switching
	- [x] International emigration rate before and after EU accession
	- [ ] Measure grievances through ESS5 and ESS9: How happy are you? → correlation between happiness and emigration → are people from emigration-high regions generally unhappier?
	- [ ] Is there demographic change in emigration hit regions? Are there less younger and more older people? Does this correlate with less schools and less hospitals?
	- [ ] Grievances and vote switching: Is there a correlation between the two in general, and more so in the actual regions that are hit by emigration? → might be difficult because EES does not ask about happiness → combine EES and ESS?; or maybe Q20 “And over the next 12 months, how do you think the general economic situation in Ireland will be?”
