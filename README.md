## Research Proposal

**To Do**
- [ ] Abstract
- [ ] Conclusion
- [x] Deal with multiple sources in one parathenses; multiple sources in parentheses still include `p. `
- [ ] Figures
	- [x] Title in caption
	- [x] Place all figures at top of page
	- [x] Map
		- [x] Add caption
		- [x] Smaller?
	- [ ] International Emigration and EU Accession
		- [x] Y-axis label correct?
		- [x] Place sources in footnote? → If yes, then remove appendix
		- [ ] Make country names bigger
	- [ ] Correlation Plot
		- [x] Add title to caption
		- [ ] Plot labels larger
		- [x] Insert newlines in caption?
- [x] Add number to Dancygier causal mechanism
- [x] Latex-ify updated chain of events (p. 7)
- [x] Latex-ify empirical specification
- [x] Spell check
- [ ] Clean up References
- [x] Remove contractions
- [x] Check if double line spacing is working
- [ ] Check that links work / don’t go off page (see FT article in References)
- [x] Check all references to figures and formulas

- [ ] Preliminary Explorations
	- [x] NUTS3 emigration map
	- [x] Model emigration and vote switching
	- [x] International emigration rate before and after EU accession
	- [ ] Measure grievances through ESS5 and ESS9: How happy are you? → correlation between happiness and emigration → are people from emigration-high regions generally unhappier?
	- [ ] Is there demographic change in emigration hit regions? Are there less younger and more older people? Does this correlate with less schools and less hospitals?
	- [ ] Grievances and vote switching: Is there a correlation between the two in general, and more so in the actual regions that are hit by emigration? → might be difficult because EES does not ask about happiness → combine EES and ESS?; or maybe Q20 “And over the next 12 months, how do you think the general economic situation in Ireland will be?”
