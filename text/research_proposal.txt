# Research Proposal MA Thesis (Work in Progress)

## Research Question
How do emigration-induced service cuts affect voting behaviour in CEE EU member states?

## Introduction
2022 Dancygier uncovers a correlation between emigration and the rise of Populists Radical Parties (PRR). The authors suggest that emigration decreases an area’s quality of life (e.g., through cuts in public services) which then creates grievances amongst voters. These grievances affect voting behavior whereby voters turn against incumbents and vote for PRR parties.

Causal mechanism according to 2022 Dancygier
```
Emigration → Service Cuts → Grievances → Change in Voting Behaviour
```

However, Dancygier do not show what exactly causes a change in voting behaviour. They suggest that future research should look into what type of service cuts lead to PRR voting (p. 35).

I aim to take Dancygier’s idea of emigration causing grievances and apply it to voters changing their voting behavior in Central and Eastern European (CEE) EU member states. I pick these countries because they are strongly affected by emigration, which has also been spurred on by the EU’s freedom of movement. Available data permitting, I will examine voting behaviour at the NUTS3 level.

I want to test if Dancygier’s assumption holds. Do PRR parties profit from emigration? Or do opposition parties also benefit from voter’s grievances? I assume there to be electoral situations where a non-populist or opposition party wins elections due to emigration-induced grievances.

## Service Cuts Causing Grievances
In order to uncover possible causations of emigration-induced grievances, I suggest the following approach. Emigration is a slow yet steady attrition of a region. Due to its gradual nature, it goes largely unnoticed to the people who remain. However, there comes a point where the impact of emigration on a region reaches a tipping point, causing a watershed moment amongst its inhabitants. In this watershed moment, the people who remained in the region suddenly realise the impact emigration is having on their region. I regard these watershed moments as critical turning points in the lives of the remaining population. They can lead to dissatisfaction with existing conditions and a sense of reduced community belonging, leading to a change in their voting behavior.

I will examine three possible watershed moments that I believe significantly influence the voting behavior of the remaining residents. The first moment is the closing of local schools. Schools contribute towards community feeling (Sageman 2022, possibly Dancygier 2022, p. 33). Closing a school will reduce a community’s cohesion and negatively impact the lives of families with school-aged children. These must travel further to reach their next school or must put up with classes that have increased in size due to the consolidation of schools.

The second watershed moment is the closing of hospitals. Because emigrants tend to be younger (2022 Lim, p. 39), the remaining population is likely to be older. The elderly are more reliant on hospitals, thus I argue that a hospital closure can cause distress and thus grievances amongst the remaining population.

Dancygier 2022 show that newspapers report about schools and hospitals closing in emigration-hit regions in Sweden (p. 32). This indicates that there may exist a link between these closures and grievances.

The third and final watershed moment is the decrease in the number of public spaces that act as “third places”. These are local “informal public gathering places” that foster community building (1989 Oldenburg, p. 16), e.g., cafés, bars and restaurants. Their closure can erode a communal sense of belonging and push people towards populist parties (Bolet 2021).

	- The closure of public spaces, a focal point for community interaction and belonging as per Bolet (2021), also contributes to the erosion of a communal sense of belonging

- A region’s overall socioeconomic climate will impact the perception of these watershed moments.
- Inhabitants of a region that is worse off will develop stronger grievances by the closures described above, thus having a stronger affect on voting behaviour.
- I intend on factoring in the socioeconomic climate when modelling the causal mechanism

- In sum, I aim to isolate specific causal mechanisms to better understand how emigration-induced service reductions influence the success of political parties.
- By doing this, I aim to provide further insights into the dynamics between emigration spurred on by the EU’s Freedom of Movement, community disintegration and political outcomes

## In Development

### Theory
- Exit, voice, loyalty
- Political Opportunity Structure: Emigration alters the political opportunity structure of a region. “Emigration of a significant portion of the population may alter the political opportunity structure in the region. Emigration can lead to economic and social challenges, causing grievances amongst the remaining population. Opposition and populist parties can capitalize on these grievances, providing a voice to those disaffected by presenting themselves as an alternative to the status quo.”
- Issue voting, retrospective voting, prospective voting
