# Research Proposal

## Research Question
How do emigration-induced service cuts affect voting behaviour in CEE EU member states?

## Introduction
- 2022 Dancygier uncovers a link between emigration and the rise of Populists Radical Parties (PRR).
- 2022 Dancygier suggests that emigration decreases an area’s quality of life (e.g., through cuts in public services). This creates grievences amongst voters.
- These grievances change a voting behavior. Voters turn against incumbents and vote for PRR parties

Causal mechanism according to 2022 Dancygier
```
Emigration → Service Cuts → Grievances → Change in Voting Behaviour
```

- However, Dancygier does not uncover specific causations of changes in voting behaviour. They suggest that future research should look into what type of service cuts lead to PRR voting (p. 35).

- I aim to take the idea of emigration causing grievences and apply it to voters changing their voting behavior in Central and Eastern European (CEE) EU member states.
- I pick these countries because they are strongly affected by emigration, which has been facilitated by the EU’s freedom of movement
- If the available data allows, I will examine voting behaviour at the NUTS3 level.
- I want to test if Dancygier’s assumption holds. Do PRR parties profit from emigration? Or do opposition parties also benefit from voter’s grievances? I assume there to be electoral situations where a non-populist opposition party beats a PRR party.

## Service Cuts that case Grievances
- In order to uncover possible causations of emigration-induced grievences, I suggest the following approach.
- I argue that emigration is a slow yet steady attrition of a region. Due to its gradual nature, it goes largely unnoticed to the people who remain. 
- However, there comes a point where the impact of emigration on a region reaches a certain tipping point, causing a watershed moment amongst its inhabitants
- In this watershed moment, the people who remained in the region suddenly realise the impact emigration is having on their region
- I regard these watershed moments as critical turning points in the lives of the remaining population
- They can lead to a sentiment of dissatisfaction with existing conditions and a sense of reduced community belonging, leading to a change in their voting behavior

- I will analyze three possible watershed moments that I believe significantly influence the voting behavior of the remaining residents

- The first moment is the closing of local schools.
	- The closure of schools, according to Sageman (2022) and possibly Dancygier (2022, p. 33), is believed to contribute to the reduction of community feeling.

- The second moment is the closing of hospitals.
	- The closing of hospitals may cause distress among the remaining voters, who may tend to be older and thus more reliant to hospitals (maybe: Dancygier (2022, p. 33))

- The third and final moment is the closing of public spaces that act as “third places”, e.g., cafés, bars or restaurants.
	- The closure of public spaces, a focal point for community interaction and belonging as per Bolet (2021), also contributes to the erosion of a communal sense of belonging

- A region’s overall socioeconomic climate will impact the perception of these watershed moments.
- Inhabitants of a region that is worse off will develop stronger grievances by the closures described above, thus having a stronger affect on voting behaviour.
- I intend on factoring in the socioeconomic climate when modelling the causal mechanism

- In sum, I aim to isolate specific causal mechanisms to better understand how emigration-induced service reductions influence the success of political parties.
- By doing this, I aim to provide further insights into the dynamics between emigration spurred on by the EU’s Freedom of Movement, community disintegration and political outcomes

## In Development

### Theory
- Exit, voice, loyalty
- Political Opportunity Structure: Emigration alters the political opportunity structure of a region. “Emigration of a significant portion of the population may alter the political opportunity structure in the region. Emigration can lead to economic and social challenges, causing grievances amongst the remaining population. Opposition and populist parties can capitalize on these grievances, providing a voice to those disaffected by presenting themselves as an alternative to the status quo.”
- Issue voting, retrospective voting, prospective voting

### Data
