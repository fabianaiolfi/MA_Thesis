## Introduction
<!-- Central problem / puzzle that thesis will address -->
Central and Eastern European (CEE) European Union (EU) member states^[Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia] have shown high levels of emigration in the past 20 years (see Figure \ref{fig:net_migration_map}). Their accession to the EU has spurred on emigration, facilitated by the EU’s Freedom of Movement (FoM). How does emigration affect political behaviour in sending countries? Theory tells us that emigration leads to service cuts, which in turn create grievances amongst the remaining population [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022]. They then turn against the incumbent party [@bowlerStrategicProtestVoting]. So which emigration-induced service cuts lead to an anti-incumbent vote?

This question is relevant for three reasons. First, emigration has a profound impact on sending countries (e.g., see @thautEUIntegrationEmigration2009a). Second, emigration is a salient issue amongst the remaining population [@rice-oxleyEuropeSouthEast2019]. Third, the effects of emigration on CEE EU member states is a blind spot in political science research [@kyriaziPoliticsEmigrationEurope2023a].

The United Nations estimated a population decline of 18 million people in Eastern Europe between the early 1990s and 2015, with emigration being the main reason for the decline [@romeiEasternEuropeHas2016]. In one concrete example, Lithuania has lost a quarter of its population, with certain regions losing over 50% of residents [@ubarevicienePopulationDeclineLithuania2017a 58]. Intra-EU migration is driven by economic and labour market factors, as people emigrate to look for better job opportunities [@vasilopoulouOpportunityThreatPublic2019a 810].

Does a country’s accession to the EU, and with it gaining access to the EU’s Freedom of Movement (FoM), have an effect on emigration rates? Figure \ref{fig:migr_accession_bar} displays a selection of countries that provided data on international emigration before and after the country’s accession. The vertical blue line represents when the country joined the EU. The time span covers, when data are available, ten years before and after accession.

I perform a Chow-Test [@chowTestsEqualitySets1960] for each individual country to examine if EU accession creates a break in the rate of emigration over time. The results show that, apart from the Czech Republic, EU accession does create a break in the time series with conventional significance ($p < 0.05$). Because of these breaks in the emigration rates, I assume that there is a link between a country’s accession to the EU and a change in emigration rate. This is because a country’s membership in the EU makes emigration easier, due to the EU’s FoM. The FoM transition period, that all EU member states were allowed to implement in order to adjust for immigrants from new member states, is not taken into account here.

Emigration has profound impacts on sending countries, e.g., population decline, lack of labour [@thautEUIntegrationEmigration2009a 220; @roosCompensatingEffectsEmigration2023a 187] or a change in the population’s ethnic profile [@vorlanderMIDEM2021Emigration2021 51]. Emigration affects individuals through a sense of loss or by causing anger, distress and depression [@marchetti-mercerThoseEasilyForgotten2012a 388; @ivlevsEmigrationRemittancesSubjective2019 135].

Does emigration change the voting behaviour of the people left behind? Theory tells us that emigration creates grievances amongst the remaining voters,  [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022, 2]. I follow 2022 Hinterleitner’s definition of grievances, who sees them to be negative emotions built around fear or anger against a specific “other” (p. 673).

@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 show how these grievances lead to voting for populist and radical right (PRR) parties. I argue that these grievances can also cause a less radical shift in voting behaviour, e.g., an anti-incumbent vote. This argument is underlined by @bowlerStrategicProtestVoting, who tells us that grieving, dissatisfied voters are prone to casting a ballot against the incumbent [@bowlerStrategicProtestVoting, 489]. Furthermore, @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 focuses on Sweden. I argue that the phenomenon of emigration and vote behaviour change can also be applied to CEE EU member states. This is because the typical impacts of emigration, e.g., population decline or labour shortages, are not bound to a specific country.

Therefore, this thesis asks the following research question: Which emigration-induced service cuts have a negative impact on the sending country’s incumbent vote share?

<!-- Describe causal mechanism -->
@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 describe how emigration leads to voting for PRR parties. Regions with high emigration rates are prone to service cuts. These cuts cause grievances amongst the people left behind, who react by voting for PRR parties [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022, 2]. However, the authors do not show what exactly causes a change in voting behaviour and suggest that future research should look into what type of service cuts eventually lead to PRR voting [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022, 35].

This thesis will examine three types of emigration induced service cuts that can cause grievances. These cuts are school closures, hospital closures and closures of “third places” [@oldenburgGreatGoodPlace1999 16], such as cafés and restaurants. I put forward the idea that these service cuts cause grievances that in turn lead to an anti-incumbent vote.

<!-- Why is it worth studying? -->
There is a research gap when it comes to understanding the political repercussions of emigration on sending regions [@kyriaziPoliticsEmigrationEurope2023a 564]. This despite the fact that, globally seen, the people who do *not* emigrate outnumber the people who do [@marchetti-mercerThoseEasilyForgotten2012a 378]. In the specific case of the EU, the FoM should be studied not only from the view of a right to enter, but also as a right to exit [@bruzeliusTakingEmigrationSeriously2021a 35].

FoM, a foundational aspect of the EU, affects voting behaviour in all member states, regardless if they are sending or receiving migrants. Understanding how FoM alters voting behaviour in emigration-hit regions will help understand the effects of future European integration, e.g., when further Balkan states or the Ukraine join the EU.^[2023 State of Union address by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at 1h 5min 41sec (https://www.youtube.com/live/3CodB7iohUI?si=xe06mS4q8qjeJYpi&t=3941, retrieved 6 October 2023)]

<!-- caveats / limitations -->
A caveat of this thesis will be the difficulty of disentangling the effect of emigration on an anti-incumbent vote, as many factors can lead to a vote against the incumbent party.
