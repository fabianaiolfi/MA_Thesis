## Abstract

Emigration from Central and Eastern European (CEE) EU member states is notably high. This thesis seeks to understand its implications for citizens in sending countries. Drawing inspiration from Swedish research, I explore whether emigration-induced service cuts lead to an anti-incumbent vote. Specifically, this research will examine if service cuts in the form of school and hospital closures, as well as the shutdown of "third places" like bars and caf√©s, encourage anti-incumbent voting in CEE EU states. By confirming these hypotheses, the thesis aims to shed light on the broader impacts of the EU's Freedom of Movement and how future EU enlargement may shape voting behaviour in new member states.
