# Summary
This document provides an overview of my current data analysis. It starts with an overview of all eleven CEE EU member states. Descriptive statistics display insights into the available data on anti-incumbent voting and emigration rates. I then continue by modelling emigration on incumbent vote change using a fixed effects model. Results show that an increase in emigration is associated with a decrease in incumbent vote share.

I then focus on the effects of service cuts in Poland and Romania. I examine these two CEE EU member states separately. I again begin with descriptive statistics that provide an overview of the available data: population numbers, emigration rates, number of institutions per region and calculated ratios, e.g., number of children per school. Then I model the effects of service cuts on incumbent vote change, again using fixed effects models. I combine different independent variables in order to measure their combined effects. I also use the actual number of institutions instead of the ratio as independent variables, to see if results change. I also calculate the average change of the independent variables between elections in order to see if these changes over time influence incumbent vote share. Finally, I also add interaction terms between the independent variables and emigration rates.

Results partially align with what my theory predicts. Romania displays the most promising results. The average change of children per school and people per hospital have a negative effect on incumbent vote share when dependent on the level of emigration (see Table 11). For example, an increase of children per school, when moderated by the level of emigration, has a negative impact on incumbent vote change. Also a decrease in the average number of schools, when moderated by emigration, has a negative effect on incumbent vote share (see Table 14).
