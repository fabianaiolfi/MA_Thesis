## Introduction
<!-- Central problem / puzzle that thesis will address -->

Central and Eastern European (CEE) European Union (EU) member states^[Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia] have shown high levels of emigration in past years and decades. Figure X provides an overview of migration levels across Europe. It shows that emigration has been generally higher in CEE regions compared to other parts of Europe.

![](../documentation/01_average_net_migration_map.png)

The United Nations estimate a population decline of 18 million people in Eastern Europe between the early 1990s and 2015, with emigration being the main reason for the decline [@romeiEasternEuropeHas2016]. In one concrete example, Lithuania has lost a quarter of its population, with certain regions losing over 50% of residents [@ubarevicienePopulationDeclineLithuania2017a]. Emigration within the EU are driven by economic and labour market factors, as people emigrate to look for better job opportunities [@vasilopoulouOpportunityThreatPublic2019a].

Does a country’s accession to the EU, and with it gaining access to the EU’s Freedom of Movement (FoM), have an effect on emigration rates? Figure X displays a simple visualisation of a selection of countries that provided data on international emigration around the country’s accession. Figure X displays all years that were retrievable. The vertical blue line represents when the country joined the EU. The time span covers, when data is available, 10 years before and 10 years after accession. The FoM transition period, that all EU member states were allowed to implement in order adjust for immigrants from new member states, is not taken into account here.

I perform a Chow test for each individual country to examine if EU accession creates a break in the time series. The results show that, apart from the Czech Republic, EU accession does create a break in the time series with conventional significance ($p < 0.05$). Because of these breaks in the emigration rates, we can assume that there is a link between a country’s accession to the EU and a change in emigration rate. This is because a country’s membership in the EU makes emigration easier, so FoM increases the effects of emigration.

![International Emigration and EU Accession (select countries). Sources: See appendix](../documentation/international_emigration_eu_accession.png)

Emigration has profound impacts on the sending countries, e.g., population decline, lack of labour (@thautEUIntegrationEmigration2009a, @roosCompensatingEffectsEmigration2023a) or a change in the population’s ethnic profile [@vorlanderMIDEM2021Emigration2021, p. 51]. Emigration affects individuals through a sense of loss or by causing anger, distress and depression (@marchetti-mercerThoseEasilyForgotten2012a, @ivlevsEmigrationRemittancesSubjective2019).

Does emigration change the voting behaviour of the people left behind? There exists a correlation between emigration rates and vote switching. There is a negative significant ($p < 0.05$) correlation between average migration rate and vote switching: The higher the average emigration rate, the higher the number of vote switchers in the NUTS3 region (see Figure X for details). The model’s rate of change is also substantial: A 10% increase in emigration is associated with an increase of switchers by roughly 3.6%, enough to sway an election. However, this correlation contains a caveat. The migration data do not differentiate between internal and external migration, thus the effect of EU accession cannot be measured directly.

![An increase of average migration by 1\% leads to a decrease of a region’s share of switchers by $-0.3641%$ ($p = 0.0305$). A negative migration rate means the region has experienced more emigration than immigration. Adjusted R-squared: $0.1146$; $N = 33$ Sources: European Election Studies for vote switching; Eurostat’s CNMIGRATRT variable for crude rate of net migration plus statistical adjustment.](../documentation/migr_and_switching.png)

Despite the caveat, this thesis will ask the following research question. Why does international emigration from CEE EU member states cause vote switching amongst the voters left behind?

<!-- Describe causal mechanism -->
@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 describe how emigration lead to voting for populist and radical right (PRR) parties: Regions hit by high emigration are prone to service cuts. These cuts cause grievances amongst the people left behind, who react by voting for PRR parties. However, the authors do not show what exactly causes a change in voting behaviour and suggest that future research should look into what type of service cuts eventually lead to PRR voting [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022, p. 35].

This thesis will examine three types of emigration induced service cuts that can cause grievances. The service cuts are school closures, hospital closures and closures of “third places” [@oldenburgGreatGoodPlace1999, p. 16], such as cafés and restaurants. I put forward the idea that these service cuts occur gradually, unbeknownst to the population who do not emigrate. These service cuts build up until reaching a tipping point, when an individual experiences a watershed moment, realising how emigration has had a negative impact on their surroundings. This watershed moment leads to grievances, that in turn alter an individual’s voting behaviour.

<!-- Why is it worth studying? -->
There is a research gap when it comes to understanding the political repercussions of emigration on sending regions [@kyriaziPoliticsEmigrationEurope2023a]. This despite the fact that, globally seen, the people who do not emigrate outnumber the people who do [marchetti-mercerThoseEasilyForgotten2012a, p. 378]. In the specific case of the EU, FoM should be studied not only from the view of a right to enter, but also as a right to exit [@bruzeliusTakingEmigrationSeriously2021a, p. 35].

FoM, a foundational aspect of the EU, affects voting behaviour in all member states, regardless if they are sending or receiving people. Understanding how FoM alters voting behaviour in emigration-hit regions will help understand the effects of further European integration, e.g., when other Balkan states or Ukraine join the EU.

<!-- caveats / limitations -->
A caveat of this thesis will be the difficulty of disentangling the effect of emigration on individual voting behaviour. This problem is linked to a potential lack of individual level data, which may result in resorting to aggregated data, such as electoral results, which will lead to less accurate results.


## State of the Field

<!--
==Why does emigration from CEE EU member states cause vote switching amongst the voters left behind?==

Present and discuss the answers that the available literature offers to your RQ
1. what we already know and what we do not yet know about your research question
2. how your work will build on previous research
-->

Emigration has affected vote switching and electoral outcomes. This at different times in different places, ranging from 19th century Sweden [@karadjaExitVoicePoliticala] to Mexico at the start of the 21st century [@pfutzeClientelismSocialLearning2014a].

Emigration can affect electoral outcomes in two ways. First, emigration can change the composition of the electorate. 2022 Lim shows that emigrants from CEE are disproportionately younger, cosmopolitan and politically progressive, resulting in a remaining population that is older and more conservative. As a result, electoral results are more likely to be conversative. However, with respect to my research question, this does not necessarily *change* their voting behaviour. It simply changes the majority relations in the population.

Second, emigration can affect the electoral preferences of the people left behind. Altering their voting behaviour can trigger vote switching. Emigration can have an indirect and a direct effect on a voter’s political behaviour.

The indirect effect is when emigration alters a voter’s overall wellbeing. Family members or neighbours of emigrants have a higher life satisfaction and budget easing through remittances, but suffer from more depression and stress [@ivlevsEmigrationRemittancesSubjective2019] and are more prone to psychological distress (@marchetti-mercerThoseEasilyForgotten2012a in @limElectoralConsequencesInternational2023), caused by people close to them who have left.

There are multiple direct effects of emigration on political behaviour. A wide range of literature explains how emigration causes a decrease in political interest. This can be caused by a decrease in political mobilisation and collective action [@sellarsEmigrationCollectiveAction2019a], a decrease in civic engagement (@goodmanExitLeavingPolitical2008, `Bravo, Jorge, 2007`), opposing voices leaving and thus resulting in a quiescent electorate [@petersEmigrationPoliticalContestation2022a] or through a loss of political actors [@limElectoralConsequencesInternational2023].

Despite this decrease in political interest, some remainers still vote. If the number of people voting shrinks, then it becomes all the more important to understand how the remaining voters are affected by emigration and how they thus cast their ballot.

One concrete example why this is important is shown by 2017 Barsbai, who reveals a negative effect between emigration and votes for the Communist Party in the Moldovan elections of 2009 and 2010. Elections during those years brought significant political change to the ex-soviet country [@barsbaiEffectLaborMigration2017a, p. 41], because voters switched away from the Communist Party, who had gained electoral power in previous elections. Voters switched because returning emigrants brought western social norms and political preferences to Moldova [@barsbaiEffectLaborMigration2017a, p. 66]. These preferences then diffused amongst the electorate.

Another reason why emigration is important is because some research uncovers links between emigration and voters switching to populist and radical parties (@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022, 2022 Lim, 2020 Otteni). However, there are two reasons why this link between emigration and radical parties can be questioned.
 
First, 2020 Mercator and 2023 Schütze provide mixed results of this claim, showing that emigration induced support for these parties is only given under certain conditions, or look at country-specific cases such as intra-German migration from east to west (2023 Schütze).
 
Second, there are three points to be made that non-extreme parties, e.g. a mainstream opposition party, may also benefit from emigration. One, a voter does not necessarily have to cast a ballot for an extreme party. Instead they can simply critique the incumbent government or status quo parties if emigration becomes politicised (mercator 2020). Two, voters receive remittances which realigns their party preferences closer to their personal ideological preferences (2012 pfutze). This does not necessarily have to be an extreme party. Three, voters will not cast a vote for a extreme party if there is no extreme party on the ballot. For these three reasons and due to the mixed empirical results, I will look into vote switching in general and not focus on voting for radical right parties.

@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 uncover a correlation between emigration and the rise of Populist Radical Parties (PRR). The authors suggest that emigration decreases an area's quality of life, e.g., through cuts in public services. These service cuts create grievances amongst voters. These grievances then affect voting behaviour. Voters turn against incumbents and cast a ballot for PRR parties.

I argue that these grievances are different to the ones described by 2018 Nikolova. Nikolova’s grievances are more personal and intimate, caused by family matters. Dancygier’s grievances are less intimate and of more general and economic nature. Because they are less intimate, I argue that a person is more likely to voice them in public, e.g., by changing their voting behaviour. This claim is supported by 2014 Kapur, who underlines the importance of understanding the reason behind a person’s emigration. Emigration from CEE EU member states is primarily due to economic reasons (2018 Vasilopoulou), thus I assume the grievances of the people left behind to be closely linked to economic factors and less to family matters.

The causal mechanism according to @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 can be summarised as follows:

$$Emigration \rightarrow Service \; Cuts \rightarrow Grievances \rightarrow Vote \; for \; PRR$$

However, the authors do not show which service cuts lead to cause grievances, thus influencing a voter’s behaviour that leads them to cast a vote for PRR parties [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022, p. 35]. They leave this aspect open for future research. This thesis sets out to detect which emigration induced service cuts cause vote switching and will not focus soley on PRR parties and all available parties.


## Project Description

<!-- theory: what would we expect to happen based on theory? -->
@keyResponsibleElectorateRationality1966a states that voters evaluate a government’s past performance and their policy outcomes (1966 @keyResponsibleElectorateRationality1966a, p. 9, p. 58-59, p. 61). They vote retrospectively and their voting behaviour is influenced by salient issues (p. ?), such as the described service cuts. Service cuts, especially cuts to public services, will give the incumbent government a poor performance record in the eyes of the voter. This will increase the likelihood that the voter switches party, away from the incumbent, towards another party.

<!-- Make explicit the causal mechanism -->
Based on @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022’s assumption that service cuts lead to grievances which then lead to PRR voting, this thesis asks the following question: Which emigration induced service cuts cause grievances?

<!--
preliminary exploration: measure grievances through ESS5, 9: How happy are you? → correlation between happiness and emigration → are people from emigration-high regions generally unhappier?

- preliminary exploration: demographic change in emigration hit regions → less younger, more older → less schools, less hospitals

- preliminary exploration: grievances and vote switching? is there a correlation between the two in general, and more so in the actual regions that are hit by emigration? → might be difficult because EES does not ask about happiness → combine EES and ESS?; or maybe Q20 “And over the next 12 months, how do you think the general economic situation in Ireland will be?”
-->

To answer this question, I suggest the following approach. As international_emigration_eu_accession.png shows, emigration existed before a country’s accession to the EU and have a gradual nature across most countries. Due to this steady attrition of a country’s population, emigration goes largely unnoticed to the individual who remains. However, there comes a point where the impact of emigration on a region reaches a tipping point, causing a watershed moment amongst its inhabitants. In this watershed moment, the remaining people suddenly realise the impact emigration is having on their region. I regard these watershed moments as critical turning points in the lives of the remaining population. They can lead to dissatisfaction with existing conditions and a sense of reduced community belonging, leading to a change in their voting behaviour.

I will examine three possible watershed moments that I believe significantly influence the voting behaviour of the remaining residents. The first moment is the closing of local primary and secondary schools. Schools contribute towards community feeling [@sagemanSchoolClosuresRural2022]. Closing a school will reduce a community's cohesion and negatively impact the lives of families with school-aged children. They must either travel further to reach the next school or must put up with classes that have increased in size due to the consolidation of schools.

The second watershed moment is the closing of hospitals. Because emigrants tend to be younger [@limElectoralConsequencesInternational2023, p. 39], the remaining population is likely to be older. The elderly are more reliant on hospitals, thus I argue that a hospital closure can cause distress and thus grievances amongst the remaining population. Hospitals closures in CEE are spurred on by the emigration of medical professionals (2020 Mercator, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/21/romanian-hospitals-in-crisis-as-emigration-take-its-toll). 

<!-- preliminary exploration: change of demographics in emigration hit regions --> 
To underline the importance of these two watershed moments, [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022, p. 32] shows how newspapers report on schools and hospitals closing in Swedish emigration-hit regions. This indicates that there may exist a link between these closures and grievances.

Schools and hospitals closings are services made available by the state. In contrast, the third and final watershed moment I will examine is a service cut in the private sector, namely the decrease in the number of public spaces that act as "third places". These are local "informal public gathering places" that foster community building [@oldenburgGreatGoodPlace1999, p. 16], e.g., cafés, bars and restaurants. Their closure can erode a communal sense of belonging and push people towards populist parties [@boletDrinkingAloneLocal2021].

This is the updated chain of events, based on @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 (refer to chain of events further up)

Emigration → Service Cuts → Watershed Moment → Grievances → Vote Switching

<!-- operationalisation, model specification --> 
Based on causal chain of events put forward by @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 (reference to formula number), I set up the following empirical specification:

<!-- 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
Switcher \; Share_{i,j} = \beta_0 & + \beta_1Service \; Cuts_{i,j} \\
      & + \beta_2External \; Emigration_{i,j} \\
      & + \beta_3Economic \; Factors_{i,j} \\
      & + \beta_4Remittances_{i,j} \\
      & + \varepsilon 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

 --> 
 
 ![](model_spec.png)

i indexes a NUTS3 region in year j. The dependent variable is the share of vote switchers in the electorate who “moved across party lines” (1966 Key, p. 16), i.e., switched from one party to another, between two national elections. 

I will measure individual level vote switching using EES data (source). If a respondent’s answer to question 9 is not the same party as the highest rated party in question 10, then they are labelled a vote switcher.^[From the European Parliament Election Study 2019 Irish Country Questionnaire (source):
Question 9: “Which party did you vote for at the Irish General Election of 2016?” 
Question 10: “We have a number of parties in Ireland each of which would like to get your vote. How probable is it that you will ever vote for the following parties? Please answer on a scale where 0 means "not at all probable" and 10 means "very probable”.”]

Service Cuts, the main independent variable, are operationalised as ratios to its respective target audience. There is one service cut for each watershed moment described above. The first are the number of children to schools in a region. The second is the population size to number of hospitals in a region. The third is the number of third places (cafés, bars, restaurants) to population size in a region.

<!-- Control Variables --> 
I will control for the following variables. First, external emigration from a region, which entails the crude number of citizens emigrating abroad from the region. Second, I take the inflow of remittances in a region, because remittances can realign a voter’s party preferences in favor of ideological preferences, thus changing their voting behaviour (2012 Pfutze). Third, I take a region’s economic factors, e.g. unemployment or GDP per capita, into account. I do this because I assume that a region's overall socioeconomic climate will impact the perception of the described watershed moments. Inhabitants of a region that is worse off will develop stronger grievances if schools, hospitals and third places close down. This in turn will have a stronger affect on voting behaviour.

<!-- Hypotheses as a general answer to the puzzle --> 
As a general relation between dependent and independent variable, I assume a higher ratio in service cuts, e.g., more children per school, leads to a higher share of vote switchers.

<!-- Public service cuts --> 
<!-- Emigration → Change in age distribution --> 
**H1**: A higher ratio of children to schools in a region leads to a higher share of vote switchers in that region.

<!-- Emigration → Population decline, labour shortage -->
**H2**: A higher ratio of seniors to hospitals in a region leads to a higher share of vote switchers in that region.

<!-- Private service cuts -->
<!-- Emigration → Population decline, labour shortage -->
**H3**: A higher ratio of people to third places in a region leads to a higher share of vote switchers in that region.

## Research Design
<!-- The research design (how, where and when?) -->
<!-- List research operations: Why are they best to tackle RQ? -->

I differentiate between internal and external migration and focus on the latter, as I want to examine the effect of the EU’s Freedom of Movement on emigration.

I will measure the effect of service cuts on a subnational level. Specifically NUTS3 level, data permitting. I do this for the following two reasons. First, a higher sample size provides more accurate results when measuring the effect of service cuts. Second, regions have different levels of emigration (see map of average emigration rate over last 20 years). This results in regions being affected in different ways. 

<!-- justify case selection of geographical and temporal span: what's their logic and are there disadvantages? -->

I will examine CEE EU member states because they are strongly affected by emigration, which I assume to have been amplified by the EU’s Freedom of Movement (see figure international_emigration_eu_accession.png and other sources in the introduction). In order to measure an effect of a country joining the EU, I will focues on a time span around the country’s accession. E.g., ten years before and after joining, if data is available for the time span. The time span will only go up to and include the year 2019, because I assume the COVID-19 pandemic to have a strong influence on emigration in 2020 and beyond.

A potential disadvante of the case selection could be cultural differences within CEE EU member states, leading to inaccurate results. I have chosen a very broad definition of CEE countries, possibly making a comparison between regions difficult. It may make sense to narrow down the selection, e.g., by excluding the three Baltic states. A further disadvantage is missing data in emigration time series and a lack of individual level data at NUTS3 level.

<!-- Methodology -->
I will use quantitative methods to answer my research question. In order to gain a general overview, I will perform a subgroup analysis, e.g., by analysing NUTS3 regions within a country. For starters, I will build simple regression models that uncover a potential correlation between emigration and vote switching. Data quality permitting, I can focus on regions that show promising results.

Such a focus may involve mediation analysis. Due to the chain of causal events described in XXX, Service Cuts act as a mediator between Emigration and Vote Switching. This analysis can help explain how the three service cuts influence vote switching in different ways.

A further deep dive could be using the Regression Discontinuity Design method in order to compare regions across EU and non-EU countries. This would use EU accession as the treatment and would allow to measure the effect of introducing FoM.

<!-- Data -->
NUTS3 level migration data is provided by Eurostat.^[Variable: CNMIGRATRT; Online data code: DEMO_R_GIND3; Link: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/DEMO_R_GIND3__custom_7113680/default/table?lang=en (retrieved 4 September 2023)] However, these data do not differentiate between internal and external migration. Data that do make this differentiation are provided by the national statistics agencies of the countries in the selection (see sources for figure international_emigration_eu_accession.png).

Data on individual level vote switching is provided by the European Election Study (EES, source). Of the around 7300 respondents from CEE countries, about 2700, or roughly a third, are assigned to a NUTS3 region. Data on individual level well-being (happiness, grievances) is provided by the European Social Survey (ESS, source) and the European Values Study (EVS, source). Data on school closings in Croatia is available through the Croatian Bureau of Statistics.^[https://podaci.dzs.hr/en/statistics/education/basic-and-upper-secondary-schools/ (5 September 2023: site can’t be reached)]

<!-- Possible further developments -->
The thesis can be expanded in the following three ways. First, going beyond vote switching, which parties explicitly profit from emigration? Which parties do the switchers switch to? NUTS3 level electoral results are provided by the EU-NED European NUTS-Level Election Dataset^[https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IQRYP5, (retrieved 5 September 2023)]. Individual level data from Poland provided by the Polish Panel Survey (POLPAN, https://polpan.org/en/, (retrieved 5 September 2023)) can also help expand on this question.

Second, regional elections can be taken into account. I am currently examining vote switching between parties in national election. However, it may also make sense to take regional elections into account, as these are closer to NUTS3 regions and thus more directly affected by emigration from a region.

A third expansion could take a non-EU CEE country, like Albania, Moldova, Serbia or Montenegro, into account. This can potentially help measure the impact of EU accession on emigration.
