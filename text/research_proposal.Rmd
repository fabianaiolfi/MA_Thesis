## Abstract
[1000 characters]

## RQ
Why does emigration from CEE EU member states cause vote switching amongst the voters left behind?

###############

## Introduction
`Central problem / puzzle that thesis will address`
- CEE countries show high levels of emigration (numbers, source)
	- 2017 Ubareviciene: Since the 1990s, lithuania lost almost one-quarter of its population, and some regions within the coun- try lost more than 50% of their residents. 
	- 2018 Vasilopoulou: The key drivers of intra-EU migration were economic, related to labour market factors, with EU migrants moving abroad to seek better job opportunities
	- Potential exploration: is there a correlation between end of Freedom of Movement-transitional period and increase in external migration? → if yes, this would help this thesis’ case of the EU’s effect on emigration in CEE → see job vacancy stats https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/labour-market/database; see also employment rate https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/lfs/database
	- also 2016 FT
- Emigration has profound effects in the sending countries. E.g. lack of labour, population decline;
	- also affects individuals, e.g. through a sense of loss, anger or distress (2012 Marchetti‐Mercer); 2019 Ivlevs: We also document that having household members abroad is linked with increased stress and depression, which are not offset by remittances → In short: emigration leaves no one indifferent
	- 2009 Thaut for specific country case
- The EU’s freedom of movement makes emigration easier, magnifying the effects of emigration
- How does emigration effect the people left behind? Does emigration change their voting behaviour?
- Emigration correlates with vote switching → There exists a negative significant (p<0.05) correlation between average migration and vote switching: The lower the average migration, the more vote switchers in the NUTS3 region
	- [Display data and findings]
- RQ:
	- ==Why does emigration from CEE EU member states cause vote switching amongst the voters left behind?==
	- Why does international emigration from CEE EU MS cause vote switching amgonst voters in sending countries?

`Describe causal mechanism`
- @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022
	- ==emigration → service cuts → grievances → PRR voting==
- [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022, p. 35]: do not show what exactly causes a change in voting behaviour; future research should look into what type of service cuts lead to PRR voting
- [briefly describe watershed moments; also add EU ascension as further watershed moment, or rather when CEE citizens were allowed to work/live in other EU MS]
	- [describe updated causal mechanism? with “watershed moment” after “service cuts”]

`Why is it worth studying?`
- migration has been studied at the receiving end, but the sending end hasn’t been studied enough yet (2022 Kyriazi)
	- 2012 Marchetti‐Mercer p. 378: “Toyota, Yeoh, and Nguyen (2007) argue that globally far more people are “left behind” than emigrate, but those left behind are often forgotten by research.”
	- 2020 bruzelius p. 2: “FoM not just involves the right to enter, but also the right to exit” 
- understanding political behaviour on a national and supranational level
	- how does emigration affect voting behaviour?
	- FoM is a foundational aspect of European integration and affects emigration. Important to understand the effects of FoM on voting behaviour in lieu of European Integration

`caveats / limitations`
- approximation of effect on voting behaviour
	- difficulty of disentangling individual voting behaviour affected by emigration; 
	- lack/not a lot of individual level data


## The state of the field

==Why does emigration from CEE EU member states cause vote switching amongst the voters left behind?==

`Present and discuss the answers that the available literature offers to your RQ`

- Emigration affects voting behaviour and electoral outcomes in various spatial and temporal contexts: From 19th century Sweden (2017 Karadja) to Mexico at the start of the 21st century (2014 Pfutze).

- Emigration can affect electoral outcomes in two ways.
- First, emigration can change the composition of the electorate. 2022 Lim shows that emigrants from CEE are disproportionately younger, cosmopolitan and politically progressive populations, resulting in a remaining population that is older and more conservative. They then vote accordingly.

- Second, emigration can affect the electoral preferences and the voting behaviour and thus trigger vote switching of the people left behind.

- it can affect political behaviour indirectly
- emigration cause grievances and depression amongst the people left behind
- 2018 Nikolova shows that people left behind have a higher life satisfaction and budget easing through remittances, but suffer from more depression and stress 

→ how does this influence the causal mechanism? can i assume that service cuts cause more/different grievances, that can be directed more at the government, unlike family-caused grievances?

- Emigration of family members or neighbors leaves psychological distress to those who remain behind (Marchetti-Mercer 2012 in 2022 lim)

- it can affect political behaviour directly
- A wide range of literature explains how emigration causes a decrease in political interest. This can be caused by a decrease in political mobilisation and collective action (2019 Sellars), a decrease in civic engagement (2008 Goodman / Bravo, Jorge, 2007), opposing voices leaving and thus resulting in a quiescent electorate (2022 Peters) or through a loss of political actors (2022 Lim).
- Despite this decrease in political interest, some remainers still vote. If the number of people voting shrinks, then it becomes all the more important that we understand how the remaining voters are affected by emigration and how they thus cast their ballot, because a smaller electorate wields more power (?)

- Why it is important is shown e.g. by 2017 Barsbai, who reveals a negative effect between emigration and votes for the Communist Party in the Moldovan elections of 2009 and 2010. Elections during those years brought significant political change to the ex-soviet country (2017 Barsbai, p. 41), because voters switched away from the Communist Party, who had gained electoral power in previous elections. Voters switched because western social norms and political preferences diffused amongst the electorate through emigration (p. 66).

- Another reason why emigration is important is because some research uncovers links between emigration and voters switching to populist and radical parties (@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022, 2022 Lim, 2020 Otteni), although results are mixed and support for these parties is only given under certain conditions (2020 Mercator, 2023 Schütze)
- However, there is a point to be made that non-extreme parties, e.g. a mainstream opposition party, may also benefit from emigration.
- A voter does not necessarily have to cast a ballot for an extreme party. Instead they can simply critique the incumbent government or status quo parties if emigration becomes politicised (mercator 2020)
- Voters receive remittances which realigns their party preferences closer to their personal ideological preferences (2012 pfutze). This does not necessarily have to be an extreme party. 
- People will not cast a vote for a extreme party if there is no extreme party on the ballot.
- In a specific case, 2023 Schütze shows how regional out-migration does not lead to a higher voting preference for the AfD, a German right-wing populist party.
- For these reasons and due to the mixed empirical results, I will look into vote switching in general and not focus on voting for radical right parties

- @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 uncovers a correlation between emigration and the rise of Populist Radical Parties (PRR). The authors suggest that emigration decreases an area's quality of life, e.g., through cuts in public services. These cuts create grievances amongst voters. These grievances then affect voting behaviour: Voters turn against incumbents and cast a ballot for PRR parties.

- The causal mechanism according to @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 can be summarised as follows:

$$Emigration \rightarrow Service \; Cuts \rightarrow Grievances \rightarrow Vote \; for \; PRR$$

- However, the authors do not show what type of service cuts finally lead to PRR voting [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022, p. 35] and leave this aspect open for future research.

- reason for emigration is important (2014 Kapur)
- in cee it is primarily an economic reason
- this reason influences the people left behind (kapur?)

`1. what we already know and what we do not yet know about your research question`
what we know
- emigration causes grievances, e.g. through service cuts

what we do not know
- effects of emigration in CEE
	- 2012 pfutze looks at mexico, but can the same results be expected in EU?
	- 2017 Barsbai looks at moldova, but moldova is not in the EU thus emigration has a different backdrop
	- 2022 lim: bases research in the change of the electorate, only touching on how emigration changes voting behaviour of the people left behind; Lim does not look into how emigration affects the people left behind (2022 lim, p. 46), which I intend on looking at
- unclear which service cuts cause grievances (affect voting behaviour)
- effect of the EU’s FoM on emigration and voting: 2023 Schütze only looks at internal east-west German migration, which does not take the EU’s FoM into account

`2. how your work will build on previous research`
- basic assumption that emigration causes vote switching
- @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022: what sort of servie cuts cause grievances, that then cause a vote for PRR (or in general vote switching)




## The project description (what?)

`Make explicit the causal mechanism`

**Service Cuts Causing Grievances**
- Which service cuts create grievances, that then lead to a change in voting behaviour?
In order to uncover possible causations of emigration-induced grievances, I suggest the following approach. Emigration is a slow yet steady attrition of a region. Due to its gradual nature, it goes largely unnoticed to the people who remain. However, there comes a point where the impact of emigration on a region reaches a tipping point, causing a watershed moment amongst its inhabitants. In this watershed moment, the people who have remained suddenly realise the impact emigration is having on their region. I regard these watershed moments as critical turning points in the lives of the remaining population. They can lead to dissatisfaction with existing conditions and a sense of reduced community belonging, leading to a change in their voting behaviour.

I will examine three possible watershed moments that I believe significantly influence the voting behaviour of the remaining residents. The first moment is the closing of local schools. Schools contribute towards community feeling [@sagemanSchoolClosuresRural2022]. Closing a school will reduce a community's cohesion and negatively impact the lives of families with school-aged children. They must either travel further to reach the next school or must put up with classes that have increased in size due to the consolidation of schools.

The second watershed moment is the closing of hospitals. Because emigrants tend to be younger [@limElectoralConsequencesInternational2023, p. 39], the remaining population is likely to be older. The elderly are more reliant on hospitals, thus I argue that a hospital closure can cause distress and thus grievances amongst the remaining population.

Schools and hospitals closing in emigration-hit regions in Sweden are topics that newspapers reported on [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022, p. 32]. This indicates that there may exist a link between these closures and grievances.

The third and final watershed moment is the decrease in the number of public spaces that act as "third places". These are local "informal public gathering places" that foster community building [@oldenburgGreatGoodPlace1999, p. 16], e.g., cafés, bars and restaurants. Their closure can erode a communal sense of belonging and push people towards populist parties [@boletDrinkingAloneLocal2021].


`Operationalize key terms / indicators`
- watershed moments as a ratio crossing a certain threshold



`hypotheses as a general answer to the puzzle`

place theory here? what would be expect based on the theory?

**Public service cuts**
H1: A higher ratio of children to schools in a region leads to vote switching in that region
*Emigration → Change in age distribution*

H2: A higher ratio of seniors to hospitals in a region leads to vote switching in that region
*Emigration → Population decline, labour shortage*

**Private service cuts**
H3: A higher ratio of people to cafés in a region leads to vote switching in that region
*Emigration → Population decline, labour shortage*


`define key terms`
- …


`list of “control variables”`
- transitional period between EU accession and end of FoM transitional period (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_for_workers_in_the_European_Union#Summary); unclear how to measure this: number of countries won’t do it, somehow measure economic attractiveness / pull of a country?
- received remittances in a region (see 2012 Pfutze)
- economic factors, e.g. unemployment, nuts3 gdp per capita
	- In addition to these three watershed moments, I assume that a region's overall socioeconomic climate will impact the perception of the described closures. Inhabitants of a region that is worse off will develop stronger grievances due to the watershed moments described above. This in turn will have a stronger affect on voting behaviour. I intend on factoring in the socioeconomic climate when modelling the causal mechanism.

`intervening conditions?`
`We would also strongly recommend that you explicitly specify the existence of any intervening conditions that - at the very least - change the production of the expected effects and - at most - need to be present for the hypothesized relations to hold.`



## The research design (how, where and when?)

`List research operations: Why are they best to tackle RQ?`
- …
- differentiate between internal and external migration: external migration linked to EU through FoM

`justify case selection of geographical and temporal span: what's their logic and are there disadvantages?`
- I aim to take Dancygier et al.'s idea of emigration causing grievances and apply it to voters changing their voting behaviour in Central and Eastern European (CEE) EU member states. I pick these countries because they are strongly affected by emigration, which has also been spurred on by the EU's freedom of movement (→ check if assumption holds!)
- aim: examine voting behaviour at NUTS3 level, as different regions are affected differently by emigraiton

`methodology`
…

`data`
- NUTS3 level electoral results are provided by the \underline{\href{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IQRYP5}{EU-NED European NUTS-Level Election Dataset}}.
- Data on school closings is available through the \underline{\href{https://podaci.dzs.hr/en/statistics/education/basic-and-upper-secondary-schools/}{Croatian Bureau of Statistics}}.
- internal and external migration: national stats websites


## Conclusion
```
- alluding to the original research question, reminding the reader about the main theoretical claim (in normative works)/falsifiable hypothesis (in empirical ones)
- speculating on the final product of the thesis: what kind of impact could your research have if it is successful?
```

In sum, I aim to isolate specific causal mechanisms to better understand how emigration-induced service reductions influence the success of political parties. By doing this, I will provide further insights into the dynamics between emigration spurred on by the EU's freedom of movement, community disintegration and political outcomes.

## In Development

### Theory

I am currently considering two theories to help answer my research question. The first is the political opportunity theory. @eisingerConditionsProtestBehavior1973 explains why riots in the US in the 1960s varied between cities. He concludes that some citizens were unable to voice their complaints legally because they lacked political opportunity. These people were thus more likely to riot. Applied to my research question, this theory would help explain which parties a voter would turn to if the voter is unhappy with the incumbent. Opposition and populist parties could capitalise on a voter's grievances and present themselves as alternatives to the status quo.

The second possible theory is issue voting. @keyResponsibleElectorateRationality1966a describes how voting behaviour is influenced by salient issues. I expect the aforementioned watershed moments to be of high salience for voters, thus influencing their vote choice.
