## Literature Review and Theory
- Emigration affects voting behaviour and electoral outcomes. It changes the electoral composition and influences the people left behind.
- Emigration benefits populist and radical right parties in Sweden (Dancygier et al., 2022). I argue that this also applies to CEE EU member states. I also argue that if voters cast their ballots retrospectively, it is not only populist parties that may benefit. Rather, emigration could also lead to an increase in anti-incumbent voting.
- Research question following Dancygier et al. (2022): Which emigration-induced service cuts have a negative impact on the sending country’s incumbent vote share?
- Service cuts to be examined:
	- School closures, based on Sageman (2022); Focus on primary schools, because their closures are more cumbersome than closing high schools or vocational schools
	- Hospital closures, based on ageing population (Lim 2023)
	- Third places closures, based on Bolet (2021)
- Causal chain of events based on research question: Emigration → Service Cuts → Grievances → Anti-Incumbent Vote
- Hypotheses
	- H1: Service cuts to schools lead to a decrease in the region’s incumbent vote share.
	- H2: Service cuts to hospitals lead to a decrease in the region’s incumbent vote share.
	- H3: Service cuts to “third places” lead to a decrease in the region’s incumbent vote share.
	
### Case Study Selection
- Selecting Poland and Romania as typical CEE EU member states with high emigration rates
- prototypical countries for emigration?
- migration from these countries in the media

### Control variables
- what else has an effect on incumbent vote share?
- while trying to isolate the effect of emigration and service cuts on incumbent vote share, i add to control variables in order to isolate the effects of service cuts and emigration
	- electoral volatility
	- gdp
