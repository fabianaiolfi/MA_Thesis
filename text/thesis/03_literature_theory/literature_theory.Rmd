## Literature Review and Theory

<!-- Emigration affects voting behaviour and electoral outcomes. It changes the electoral composition and influences the people left behind. -->
The impact of emigration on voting behaviour and electoral outcomes varies by time and location. A variety of studies have explored this phenomenon, ranging from 19th-century Sweden [@karadjaExitVoicePolitical2019 2] to early 21st-century Mexico [@pfutzeClientelismSocialLearning2014a 295].

Emigration can affect electoral outcomes in two ways. First, emigration can change the composition of the electorate. @limElectoralConsequencesInternational2023 [39] shows that emigrants from CEE are disproportionately younger, cosmopolitan and politically progressive, resulting in a remaining population that is older and more conservative. As a result, electoral results are more likely to be conservative.

Second, emigration can affect the voting behaviour of the people left behind. This effect can be indirect and also direct.

The indirect effect occurs when emigration alters a voter’s overall wellbeing. Family members or neighbours of emigrants have a higher life satisfaction and budget easing through remittances, but suffer from more depression and stress [@ivlevsEmigrationRemittancesSubjective2019 135] and are more prone to anger and distress [@marchetti-mercerThoseEasilyForgotten2012a 388], caused by the departure of people close to them.

There are multiple direct effects of emigration on political behaviour. A wide range of literature explains how emigration causes a decrease in political interest. This can be caused by a decrease in political mobilisation and collective action [@sellarsEmigrationCollectiveAction2019a 1220], a decrease in civic engagement [@goodmanExitLeavingPolitical2008 172; @bravoEmigrationPoliticalEngagement2009], opposing voices leaving and thus resulting in a more supportive electorate [@petersEmigrationPoliticalContestation2022a 14] or through a loss of political actors [@limElectoralConsequencesInternational2023 44].

Despite this decrease in political interest, some of the remaining electorate still votes. If the number of people casting their ballot decreases, then it becomes all the more important to understand how the remaining voters are affected by emigration and thus how they cast their ballot.

One concrete example why this is important is shown by @barsbaiEffectLaborMigration2017a [36], who reveal a negative effect between emigration and votes for the Communist Party in the Moldovan elections of 2009 and 2010. Elections during those years brought significant political change to the ex-soviet country [@barsbaiEffectLaborMigration2017a 41], because voters cast a ballot against the Communist Party, who had gained electoral power in previous elections. Voters turned against the Communist Party because returning emigrants brought western social norms and political preferences to Moldova [@barsbaiEffectLaborMigration2017a 66]. These preferences then diffused amongst the electorate.

<!-- Emigration benefits populist and radical right parties in Sweden (Dancygier et al., 2022) -->
A further reason why the effects of emigration on voting behaviour is important is its implications on voting for populist and radical right parties [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 34; @limElectoralConsequencesInternational2023 56; @heroldSchrumpfendeRegionenFrustrierte2020 19]. 

@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 [35] uncover a correlation between emigration and the rise of PRR parties. The authors suggest that emigration decreases an area’s quality of life, e.g., through cuts in public services. These service cuts create grievances amongst voters. These grievances then affect voting behaviour. Voters turn against incumbents and cast a ballot for PRR parties.

- however, there are several reasons why a vote for prr can be questioned in @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022’s chain of events
- grievances caused by emigration do not necessarily have to lead to a vote for prr. it can also just change the voting behaviour of the voter.
- this is how i argue my case
- the grievaces described by @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 are less intimate and of family nature than the ones described by @ivlevsEmigrationRemittancesSubjective2019 [135]
- @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022’s grievances are more economic nature
- the assumption that these grievances are of economic nature is underlined by the following
	- Emigration from CEE EU member states is primarily due to economic reasons [@vasilopoulouOpportunityThreatPublic2019a 810]
	- this is important to know because understanding the reason why people emigrate helps understand the impact on the sending country [@kapurPoliticalEffectsInternational2014a 488]
	- if one of the impacts caused by economic emigration are grievances, then these will be linked to economic factors and less to family matters
- because they are less intimate and of more economic nature, i argue that dancygier’s grievances are more likely to be voiced in public, e.g., at the ballot box or by changing their voting behaviour
- thus these grievances primarily affect voting behaviour in general, and don’t necessarily have to specifically lead to a prr vote

- there are further reasons why @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022’s vote for prr parties can be questioned and replaced with a more general assumption that e.g. a voter might just switch to a mainstream opposition party

- First, @vorlanderMIDEM2021Emigration2021 [36] shows that far-right parties only profit from emigration in economically weak regions. 
- by just looking at a vote for PRR, we would not examine the effect of emigration on economically stronger regions

- Second, non-extreme parties, e.g., a mainstream opposition party, may also benefit from emigration. There are three possible reasons for this. One, a voter does not necessarily have to cast a ballot for an extreme party. Instead, they can simply critique the incumbent government or status quo parties if emigration becomes politicised [@vorlanderMIDEM2021Emigration2021 91]. Two, voters receive remittances which realigns their party preferences closer to their personal ideological preferences [@pfutzeDoesMigrationPromote2012a 161]. This realignment does not necessarily have to lead to voting for an extreme party. Three, voters cannot cast a vote for an extreme party if there is no such party on the ballot. 

<!-- my contribution, see also michele’s notes; correct placement here? -->
- It remains unclear which service cuts cause grievances that in turn change voting behaviour [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 35]. The authors leave this aspect open for future research. My thesis sets out to detect which emigration induced service cuts cause grievances and thus decrease incumbent support.

<!-- theory: what would we expect to happen based on theory? -->
- @keyResponsibleElectorateRationality1966a states that voters evaluate a government’s past performance and their policy outcomes [@keyResponsibleElectorateRationality1966a 35, 58–59, 61]. They vote retrospectively and their voting behaviour is influenced by salient issues [@keyResponsibleElectorateRationality1966a 73], such as the described service cuts. These cuts affect citizens’ daily lives and cause grievances. Such grievances will give the incumbent party a poor performance record. Grieving voters that are dissatisfied with the incumbent party will not support them in the next election [@bowlerStrategicProtestVoting1992, 489].

<!-- Research question following Dancygier et al. (2022) -->
- Based on @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022’s assumption that service cuts lead to grievances which then lead to a change in voting behaviour, this thesis asks the following question: Which emigration-induced service cuts have a negative impact on the sending country’s incumbent vote share?

<!-- service cuts to be examined -->
@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 [2] state that emigration is linked to service cuts such as schools and business closures. Also, emigration strains the healthcare system. Based on this, I assume that emigration has a negative effect on the number of schools, the number of hospitals and the number of “third places”, i.e., local "informal public gathering places" such as cafés, bars and restaurants that foster community building [@oldenburgGreatGoodPlace1999 16]. Following @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022’s theory, a decrease in the number of these institutions will cause grievances amongst the remaining population for the following reasons.

<!-- schools -->
Schools contribute towards community feeling [@sagemanSchoolClosuresRural2022 964]. Closing a school will reduce a community's cohesion and negatively impact the lives of families with school-aged children. They must either travel further to reach the next school or must put up with classes that have increased in size due to the consolidation of schools.

<!-- hospitals -->
Hospitals are important for the population who do not emigrate. Because emigrants tend to be younger [@limElectoralConsequencesInternational2023 39], the remaining population is likely to be older. The elderly are more reliant on hospitals, thus I argue that a hospital closure can cause distress and thus grievances amongst the remaining population. Hospital closures in CEE are spurred on by the emigration of medical professionals [@vorlanderMIDEM2021Emigration2021 13; @walkerRomanianHospitalsCrisis2019]. 

To underline the importance of school and hospital closings, @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 [32] show how newspapers report on such closings in Swedish emigration-heavy regions. This indicates that there may exist a link between these closures and grievances.

<!-- third places -->
Schools and hospital closings are services made available by the state. In contrast, “third places” are supplied by the private sector. Their closure can erode a communal sense of belonging and push people towards populist parties [@boletDrinkingAloneLocal2021 1653].

### Hypotheses
As a general relation between dependent and independent variables, I assume an increase in service cuts leads to a decrease in incumbent support. This leads to the following three hypotheses:

- H1: Service cuts to schools lead to a decrease in the region’s incumbent support.
- H2: Service cuts to hospitals lead to a decrease in the region’s incumbent support.
- H3: Service cuts to “third places” lead to a decrease in the region’s incumbent support.

### Case Study Selection
- @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 focus on the swedish case of emigration and its effect on voting behaviour, due to the availability of detailed data in Sweden [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 34]
- they also show that emigration has a significant effect on the increased share of radical right parties [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 34], hinting at a possibility that their mechanism of emigration induced grievances and service cuts and its impact on voting behaviour can also be applied to other European states.
- For this reason, I set my general focus on CEE EU member states, because these countries have experienced a large increase in emigration since joining the EU in the 2000s, thanks to gaining access to the EU’s Freedom of Movement
- emigration in this region has not been studied in detail and here is an opportunity to measure the political impact of FoM on sending countries, an understudied aspect of FoM, as normally the focus lies on the impact of FoM on *receiving* countries
- Specifically, I set out to examine Poland and Romania as these two CEE EU member states continuously show the highest number of yearly emigrants compared to the other CEE EU member states.^[Eurostat Variable migr_emi1ctz: Total number of long-term emigrants leaving from the reporting country during the reference year (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps00177__custom_9431582/default/table?lang=en, retrieved 19 January 2024)]
- By selecting these two countries with high emigration rates, I assume it to be easier to measure the effect of emigration induced service cuts on incumbent support.

### Control variables
- in order to islolate the effect of emigration and service cuts on incumbent support, i control for the following factors that also have an effect on incumbent vote share
- I control for general electoral volatility. CEE states show higher levels of electoral volatility than states in Western Europe, Latin America or the United States [@epperlyInstitutionsLegaciesElectoral2011 831]. This volatility most often hits incumbent parties [@bochslerThreeStagesIncumbency2019 1].
- I also control for the region’s economic performance. i do this under the assumption that voters punish or reward incumbent parties based on the economic conditions that voters find themselves in. good economic performance leads to incumbent support, bad performance leads to voters punishing incumbent parties [@lewis-beckEconomicDeterminantsElectoral2000 183].
