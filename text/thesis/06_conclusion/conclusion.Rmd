## Conclusion
- Summary of thesis and findings
  - Difference between PL and RO: maybe because emigration picks up in RO and decreases in PL? see "Does EU accession affect emigration?" 
  - third places showing no effect: maybe closings aren’t associated with incumbents?
- Thesis limits
	- Effects seem country specific, no broad generalisations possible
	- many influences on incumbent support, service cuts won’t cover them all
	- i dont look at *who* is leaving, e.g. high or low-income residents [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 11], as this could have an influence on the impact of emigration, incumbent support and grievances; also there should be a difference between low- and high-skilled emigrants, which will also make a difference
	- emigration flows: limits of only looking at external emigration; however, there are different flows of emigration, e.g., from rural to urban areas within a country and then abroad [@kingMindGapIntegrating2010 1623]
	- was volatility operationalised correctly? always shows a positive coefficient, meaning that higher levels of volatiltiy are associated with higher levels of incumbent support, which does not intuitively make sense and may require more digging into
- Interpreting results in the broader context of further European integration
- Future research
	- state that causality is not that simple, there might me a mediating factor in the whole thing, which should be looked at in future research
	- Uncovering country specific service cuts
	- Effect of incumbent party on emigration
	- Other effects of emigration on sending countries, e.g. impact on democratic institutions
