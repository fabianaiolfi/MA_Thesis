## Conclusion
<!-- Summary of thesis -->
- in this thesis i set to measure the effect of emigration in incumbent support in Poland and Romania
- …
- emigration decreases incumbent support in romania, not in poland
- because of this, hypotheses are only tested in romania
- Results hint at an effect of emigration caused school closures and loss of incumbent support in Romania
- However, results are not statistically significant enough to clearly fail to reject the hypotheses set up, thus further research is needed


<!-- Thesis Limits -->

This thesis contains several limitations. 

First and foremost the fact that many factors influence incumbent support. The service cuts described in this thesis do not cover them all.

Second, this thesis does not take internal emigration into account, e.g. first from rural to urban areas and then abroad [@kingMindGapIntegrating2010 1623]. Focusing on external emigration was a conscious design decision in order to measure the impact of FoM, however there is an argument to be made that the effect on people left behind is no different between internal and external emigration – they are, in both cases, left behind. 

Third, in the preliminary analysis, we observed large differences in the results between Poland and Romania. Thus the effects may be specific to a country, hinting that no broad, pan-CEE EU member state generalisation is possible or perhaps even sensible. This hints that no single mechanism works universally across all CEE EU member states, which was an assumption I made at the start of this thesis.

Fourth, this thesis’s setup does not consider *who* is leaving. I do not consider an emigrant’s level of income [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 11] or their level of education. Both these factors can influence the entire causal chain of service cuts, grievances and finally incumbent support.

Fifth, the models to not contain data on grievances in a region. This would make the model more complete when following @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022, however  NUTS-level panel data on grievances in CEE are hard to come by and thus not added.

Sixth, the interaction coefficient results in Table \@ref(tab:results-emigration-incumbent-vote-share-control-interaction) may lack statistical power because many more observations are needed due to noise when using interactions [@gelmanYouNeed162018]. In order to counter this problem, more data is needed, e.g., over a larger time period.

Finally, as mentioned in paragraph X (TO DO: reference to end of model_spec_b.Rmd), volatility may have been operationalised incorrectly. All results show a positive coefficient, indicating that higher levels of volatiltiy are associated with higher levels of incumbent support. This is not intuitive and may be due to the simplified method of dealing with party changes when calculating the Pedersen Index. E.g., how to deal with party mergers, as described in paragraph X (TO DO: reference to Electoral Volatility in operationalisation.Rmd).

<!-- Interpreting results in the broader context of further European integration -->
- this thesis shows two things
- first, that emigration can have a negative effect on incumbent support
	- a governing party in a candidate member state should thus take this into account when proceeding with their own EU membership
	- I assume that candidate countries will consider joining the EU as an overall benefit despite the aspect of emigration and its impact
	- a candidate country could prepare for an outflux once their country joins, e.g. by preparing policies to incentivise staying at home or making a return worth while
	- however, if the incumbent are voted out of power due to FoM induced emigration, there’s a chance that e.g. Eurosceptic parties gain power. Thus FoM will have a negative effect on the EU in the long term, not only for receiving countries, which have seen an increase in anti-migrant political rhetoric, but also in sending countries, that suffer from the economic and social issues that come out of emigration
- second, despite hypothesis rejection, let us assume that school closures 
	- negative impact on education system
	- dire long term consequences, as this will lead to a generation of citizens who indirectly suffer from FoM and may feel hard done by, developing grievances and thus fuel Euroscepticism
- thus it is in the EU’s own interest to counter these negative, anti-EU tendencies that the EU brings upon itself through its own implementation of FoM.
- so next to the (candidate) member states, the EU should develop policies that dampen the effect of emigration and create incentives to return to the sending country.

<!-- Future research -->
- does party orientation have an effect in any of this?
- take detailed party mergers/party landscape changes in general more into account → more generally this links back to taking more country specific factors into account
- why is there such a difference in effect of emigration on incumbents in poland and in romania?
- what is the mid and long term effect of school closures on the education system and how does this impact future generations of citizens?
- get service cut data on more CEE countries, in order to get a bigger picture of the effects of FoM on sending countries
- state that causality is not that simple, there might me a mediating factor in the whole thing, which should be looked at in future research
- Uncovering country specific service cuts
- Effect of incumbent party on emigration
- Other effects of emigration on sending countries, e.g. impact on democratic institutions
- third places showing positive effect
