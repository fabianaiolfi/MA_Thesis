## Conclusion
<!-- Summary of thesis -->
- in this thesis i set to measure the effect of emigration in incumbent support in Poland and Romania
- …
- Results hint at an effect of emigration caused school closures and loss of incumbent support in Romania
- However, results are not statistically significant enough to clearly fail to reject the hypotheses set up, thus further research is needed

- Thesis limits
	- Effects seem country specific, no broad generalisations possible
	- many influences on incumbent support, service cuts won’t cover them all
	- i dont look at *who* is leaving, e.g. high or low-income residents [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 11], as this could have an influence on the impact of emigration, incumbent support and grievances; also there should be a difference between low- and high-skilled emigrants, which will also make a difference
	- emigration flows: limits of only looking at external emigration; however, there are different flows of emigration, e.g., from rural to urban areas within a country and then abroad [@kingMindGapIntegrating2010 1623]
	- add grievances to model; this data is hard to come by, should be integrated somewhere
	- interaction coefficients may not have enough statistical power because many more observations are needed when using interactions due to noise [@gelmanYouNeed162018]

- Interpreting results in the broader context of further European integration

- Future research
	- get service cut data on more CEE countries, in order to get a bigger picture of the effects of FoM on sending countries
	- state that causality is not that simple, there might me a mediating factor in the whole thing, which should be looked at in future research
	- Uncovering country specific service cuts
	- Effect of incumbent party on emigration
	- Other effects of emigration on sending countries, e.g. impact on democratic institutions
