## Conclusion
<!-- Summary of thesis -->
- in this thesis i set to measure the effect of emigration in incumbent support in Poland and Romania
- …
- emigration decreases incumbent support in romania, not in poland
- because of this, hypotheses are only tested in romania
- Results hint at an effect of emigration caused school closures and loss of incumbent support in Romania
- However, results are not statistically significant enough to clearly fail to reject the hypotheses set up, thus further research is needed

- Thesis limits
	- when comparing the large differences between poland and romania: Effects seem country specific, no broad generalisations possible; also, emigration patterns seems to be heterogeneous across different CEE EU member states (reference to figure TO DO). this indicates that there is not a single mechanism that works universally across all CEE EU member states
	- many influences on incumbent support, service cuts won’t cover them all
	- i dont look at *who* is leaving, e.g. high or low-income residents [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 11], as this could have an influence on the impact of emigration, incumbent support and grievances; also there should be a difference between low- and high-skilled emigrants, which will also make a difference
	- emigration flows: limits of only looking at external emigration; however, there are different flows of emigration, e.g., from rural to urban areas within a country and then abroad [@kingMindGapIntegrating2010 1623]
	- add grievances to model; this data is hard to come by, should be integrated somewhere
	- interaction coefficients may not have enough statistical power because many more observations are needed when using interactions due to noise [@gelmanYouNeed162018]

<!-- Interpreting results in the broader context of further European integration -->
- this thesis shows two things
- first, that emigration can have a negative effect on incumbent support
	- a governing party in a candidate member state should thus take this into account when proceeding with their own EU membership
	- I assume that candidate countries will consider joining the EU as an overall benefit despite the aspect of emigration and its impact
	- a candidate country could prepare for an outflux once their country joins, e.g. by preparing policies to incentivise staying at home or making a return worth while
	- however, if the incumbent are voted out of power due to FoM induced emigration, there’s a chance that e.g. Eurosceptic parties gain power. Thus FoM will have a negative effect on the EU in the long term, not only for receiving countries, which have seen an increase in anti-migrant political rhetoric, but also in sending countries, that suffer from the economic and social issues that come out of emigration
- second, despite hypothesis rejection, let us assume that school closures 
	- negative impact on education system
	- dire long term consequences, as this will lead to a generation of citizens who indirectly suffer from FoM and may feel hard done by, developing grievances and thus fuel Euroscepticism
- thus it is in the EU’s own interest to counter these negative, anti-EU tendencies that the EU brings upon itself through its own implementation of FoM.
- so next to the (candidate) member states, the EU should develop policies that dampen the effect of emigration and create incentives to return to the sending country.

<!-- Future research -->
- does party orientation have an effect in any of this?
- why is there such a difference in effect of emigration on incumbents in poland and in romania?
- what is the mid and long term effect of school closures on the education system and how does this impact future generations of citizens?
- get service cut data on more CEE countries, in order to get a bigger picture of the effects of FoM on sending countries
- state that causality is not that simple, there might me a mediating factor in the whole thing, which should be looked at in future research
- Uncovering country specific service cuts
- Effect of incumbent party on emigration
- Other effects of emigration on sending countries, e.g. impact on democratic institutions
