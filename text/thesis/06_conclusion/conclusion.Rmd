## Conclusion
<!-- Summary of thesis -->
- in this thesis i set to measure the effect of emigration in incumbent support in Poland and Romania
- …
- emigration decreases incumbent support in romania, not in poland
- because of this, hypotheses are only tested in romania
- Results hint at an effect of emigration caused school closures and loss of incumbent support in Romania
- However, results are not statistically significant enough to clearly fail to reject the hypotheses set up, thus further research is needed

<!-- Interpreting results in the broader context of further European integration -->
This thesis shows that access to FoM is associated with higher emigration, which in turn is associated with a change in voting behaviour. This highlights that migration within the EU, one its fundamental freedoms, has an impact on receiving *and* on sending countries. This impact on sending countries influences who’s in power and thus shapes politics on a national and supranational level.

Despite the hypotheses rejections, we observe that emigration can have a negative effect on incumbent support. Incumbent parties in a candidate EU member state should take this into account when going forward with their membership application. Incumbent parties are well advised to prepare for an FoM-induced outflux in order to dampen its impact and minimise the potential decrease on incumbent support that is associated with emigration. This can be achieved by implementing policies that incentivise returns, e.g., after having studied or gathered work experience abroad.

Focusing on school closures, and assuming they are linked to external emigration, a reduction in schools can detrimentally affect the education system. A decrease in school numbers could have serious long-term effects, potentially resulting in a generation receiving substandard education due to FoM-induced emigration. This educational shortfall might negatively impact job prospects, thereby fueling grievances that contribute to Euroscepticism further down the line. Therefore, it is in the EU’s own interest to address these negative and anti-EU sentiments, which ironically arise from a key EU principle, FoM. This issue could be mitigated through EU-level policies aimed at investing in the education system in regions affected by emigration. Providing for a certain educational standard will have a positive impact on future job prospects. Furthermore, educational investments should prevent school service cuts, thus eliminating the risk of citizens developing grievances in this context.

<!-- Thesis Limits -->
This thesis contains several limitations that can be addressed in future research. First and foremost is the fact that many factors influence incumbent support. The service cuts described in this thesis can not cover all factors that have an impact on incumbent support. Causality is never this simple and there may be a mediating factor in the causal mechanisms, which can be further explored in future research.

Second, this thesis strongly simplifies the flow of emigration. [@kingMindGapIntegrating2010 1623] shows that external emigration can occur in multiple steps, e.g. first internally from rural to urban areas, then from urban areas to another country. Internal emigration is not taken account in this thesis, potentially skewing emigration rates in urban NUTS3 regions. Focusing on external emigration was a conscious design decision in order to measure the impact of FoM, however there is an argument to be made that the effect on the people left behind is no different between internal and external emigration. They are, in both cases, being left behind.

Third, in the preliminary analyses, we observed large differences in all results between Poland and Romania. This could be an indication that the examined effects of emigration on incumbent support and service cuts may be specific to a country. This would mean that no broad, pan-CEE EU member state generalisation is possible or perhaps even sensible. Also, this hints that no single mechanism works universally across all CEE EU member states, which was an assumption I made at the start of this thesis. Future research could attempt to identify further forms of service cuts, potentially uncovering country specific factors.

Fourth, this thesis does not consider *who* is leaving. I do not consider an emigrant’s level of income [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 11] or their level of education. Both these factors can influence the entire causal chain of service cuts, grievances and finally incumbent support.

Fifth, the models do not contain data on grievances in a region. This would make the model more complete when following @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022’s approach. However NUTS-level panel data on grievances in CEE are not readily available and thus cannot be included.

Sixth, the interaction coefficient results in Table \@ref(tab:results-emigration-incumbent-vote-share-control-interaction) may lack statistical power due to noise that occurs when using interactions [@gelmanYouNeed162018]. In order to counter this problem, more observations are needed, e.g., data covering a longer time period. When collecting further observations, it could be of interest to obtain more electoral data, as the data provided by @schraffEuropeanNUTSlevelElection2023 only cover one election occuring before EU accession. Pre-accession electoral data would provide the opportunity to compare the effect of emigration on incumbent support *before* the introduction of FoM, yielding further insights.

Finally, as mentioned on p. \pageref{passage:volatility-issue}, volatility may have been operationalised incorrectly. All results show a positive coefficient, indicating that higher levels of volatiltiy are associated with higher levels of incumbent support. This is not an intuitive result and may be due to the simplified method of how party changes are dealt with when calculating the Pedersen Index (see p. \pageref{passage:electoral-volatility}). Future research could implement a more nuanced approach when handling party changes.

<!-- Future research -->
Based on the findings presented here, there are several avenues of future research. E.g., does incumbent party orientation play a role in the context of emigration induced service cuts? I assume that party orientation has an influence on how much and which services are cut back, thus having different impacts on the electorate. Also, does party orientation have an effect on emigration? Do more people emigrate if PRR parties are in power, e.g., as in Hungary?

Another potential future avenue is examining the long term effect of emigration induced school closures on the electorate. This can help understand how far reaching the impact of FoM is in a sending country. However, these panel data probably do not exist yet, but could be of interest once school aged children from the 2010s become of voting age in the 2020s.

Finally, further effects of emigration on sending countries beyond service cuts should be examined. Does emigration impact democratic institutions, social cohesion or other factors? Answering these questions can help obtain a bigger picture of the extent of FoM on sending countries.
