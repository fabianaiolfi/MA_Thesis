## Conclusion
- Summary of thesis and findings
  - Difference between PL and RO: maybe because emigration picks up in RO and decreases in PL? see "Does EU accession affect emigration?" 
  - third places showing no effect: maybe closings aren’t associated with incumbents?
- Thesis limits
	- Effects seem country specific, no broad generalisations possible
	- many influences on incumbent support, service cuts won’t cover them all
- Interpreting results in the broader context of further European integration
- Future research
	- state that causality is not that simple, there might me a mediating factor in the whole thing, which should be looked at in future research
	- Uncovering country specific service cuts
	- Effect of incumbent party on emigration
	- Other effects of emigration on sending countries, e.g. impact on democratic institutions
