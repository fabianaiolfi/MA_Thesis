I examine if there is an association between emigration rates and anti-incumbent voting. Following the theory, emigration cause grievances, which in turn can manifest as a vote against the incumbent party. Thus I expect that higher emigration to be associated with a decrease in incumbent vote share.

As the dependent variable I use the incumbent vote change between national parliamentary elections. The model uses the total emigration rate from a region between two elections as the independent variable. The precise operationalisation of these variables are described in XXX (TO DO). I model Poland and Romania seperately, using a fixed effects OLS estimation. Results for both models are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:emigration-incumbent-vote-share).

Emigration does not have a significant effect on incumbent voting in Poland. Also, the coefficient is positive, which indicates that an increase in emigration is associated with an increase in incumbent vote share. Romania displays a result that aligns better with my theory. Here, higher emigration rates between elections are associated with a relatively strong decrease in incumbent vote share. An increase of one emigration per thousand inhabitants of a region is associated with a decrease of incumbent vote share of about $6.5\%$. The coefficient displays statistical significance at conventional levels. Furthermore, the Romanian model displays relatively high $R^2$ levels, indicating that the model explains a large part of the dependentâ€™s variable overall variance.
