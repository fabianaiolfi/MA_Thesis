### Model Specification
Empirical specification based on operationalised variables

- in the preliminary analysis we have established that there is a negative correlation between emigration and incumbent vote share change in romania

- based on this preliminary result, i define two model specifications in order to test the hypotheses

- the first model specification attempts to examine the isolated effect of service cuts on incumbent vote share change. 
- the model’s main independent variable is service cuts. i do this to examine the direct impact of service cuts on incumbent vote share
- i then control for emigration. i do this in order to isolate the effect of service cuts, as emigration varies across NUTS3 regions within Romania.
- furthermore, i also control for electoral volatility and GDP. 

1. do service cuts affect incumbent vote share when controlling for emigration? i control for emigration in order to isolate the effect of service cuts

	- “Without controlling for emigration, it would be challenging to determine if changes in incumbent vote share are due to service cuts or the existing emigration trends.”

```
Incumbent Vote Share Change = β0 + 
	β1*Emigration +
	β2*Service Cuts +
	ε
```


2. is emigration conditioned on emigration level when examining its effect on incumbent vote share?
	- is the effect of emigration on incumbent vote share conditioned by service cuts?
	- this provides insight into the interaction between these two variables
	- “It allows you to understand if and how the impact of emigration on voting patterns is modified in the context of service cuts.”
	- “This is important because it's possible that service cuts amplify or mitigate the negative effects of emigration on incumbent support, … thus further decreasing support for the incumbent”
```
Incumbent Vote Share Change = β0 + 
	β1*Emigration +
	β2*Service Cuts +
	β3*(Emigration*Service Cuts) + 
	ε
```

- i do both approaches because it provides a more comprehensive and robust exploration of how service cuts and emigration individually and interctively influence incumbnet vote share. 




2. is there a service cut that acts as a conditioning factor that influences this relationship? → Interactions between emigration and service cuts
