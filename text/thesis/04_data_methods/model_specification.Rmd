### Model Specification
- Empirical specification based on operationalised variables

- in the preliminary analysis we have established that there is a negative correlation between emigration and incumbent vote share in romania

- i use two different approaches to answer my hypotheses:

1. do service cuts affect incumbent vote share when controlling for emigration? i control for emigration in order to isolate the effect of service cuts
	- what is the direct impact of service cuts on incumbent vote share? i try to isolate the effect
	- “Without controlling for emigration, it would be challenging to determine if changes in incumbent vote share are due to service cuts or the existing emigration trends.”

2. is emigration conditioned on emigration level when examining its effect on incumbent vote share?
	- is the effect of emigration on incumbent vote share conditioned by service cuts?
	- this provides insight into the interaction between these two variables
	- “It allows you to understand if and how the impact of emigration on voting patterns is modified in the context of service cuts.”
	- “This is important because it's possible that service cuts amplify or mitigate the negative effects of emigration on incumbent support, … thus further decreasing support for the incumbent”

- i do both approaches because it provides a more comprehensive and robust exploration of how service cuts and emigration individually and interctively influence incumbnet vote share. 




2. is there a service cut that acts as a conditioning factor that influences this relationship? → Interactions between emigration and service cuts
