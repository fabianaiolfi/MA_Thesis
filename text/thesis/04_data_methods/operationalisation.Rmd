### Operationalisation

#### Dependent Variable: Incumbent Vote Share Change
\label{passage:incumbent-vote-share-change} In my analysis, the dependent variable is the change in incumbent vote share. To operationalise this, I pick two consecutive national parliamentary elections, referred to as $E_0$ and $E_1$. Following the data provided by @staffan.i.lindbergetal.VPartyDatasetV22022 and manual adjustments (see p. \pageref{passage:incumbent-party}), I label each party as either incumbent or non-incumbent at $E_0$. Next, I calculate the change in the party's vote share between $E_0$ and $E_1$. A positive value indicates an increase in support, a negative value signifies a loss in vote share and thus less support.

#### Independent Variable: Service Cuts
I operationalise service cuts based on the assumption that a person's experience of a service is influenced by the user density per service point (e.g., schools, hospitals). As more people use a single service point, an individual’s experience of the service deteriorates. This is due to factors like diminished individual attention, overstretched personnel and longer waiting times. A service cut, such as the closure of a hospital, typically results in an increased number of users at remaining facilities, leading to a perceived decrease in service quality. By using the ratio of people per institution, I aim to capture the perceived quality of a service. This offers a more nuanced understanding than merely counting the number of institutions in a region. This approach acknowledges that the development of grievances, influenced by service quality, can eventually impact voting behavior.

Service cuts are operationalised by examining the average changing ratio of institutions to their respective target audiences between two elections. This can be best understood with an example, as displayed in Table X (TO DO). The number of primary-aged children per school in a specific NUTS region in a given year equals the ratio. This ratio varies annually and is recorded in the “yearly change” column. To calculate the average change between two elections, I average all the “yearly change” values starting from the year of the last election and ending one year before the next election. This approach aims at capturing the electorate’s retrospective vote, as voters judge the incumbent parties on past performances (see p. \pageref{passage:retrospective-vote}). When casting a ballot, I assume that they take into account the development of service quality since the last election. Service cuts lead to a decrease in service quality, which in turn can lead to a decrease in incumbent support.

- TO DO: Insert example table

As described in the Theory section on p. \pageref{passage:theory-service-cuts}, the three service cuts under examination are school and hospital closures, as well as shutting down third places. I operationalise these service cuts as the average changing ratio of primary school aged children per primary school, the average changing ratio of people per hospital and the average changing ratio of people per third place, all within a NUTS region.

#### Control Variables
In order to islolate the effect of service cuts on incumbent support, I control for external emigration, electoral volatility and economic performance within a NUTS region.

##### Emigration Rate
\label{passage:emigration-rate} When operationalising emigration rate, I base my approch on @dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022. I only take the number of departures from a NUTS region into account, in order to isolate the effect of emigration from other demographic factors that may influence the association between population decline and incumbent support [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 5]. Also, I only take *external* emigration into account, i.e., migration abroad, and discard internal emigration between subnational regions. I focus on this because I aim to capture the effect of a country’s accession to the EU and its subsequent access to FoM.

I operationalise emigration rate as the sum of emigrants in a region between two elections [@dancygierEmigrationRadicalRight2022 17], divided by the average population in that region between the elections. I then multiply this value by 1000 in order to get the value per 1000 inhabitants. Table X displays this calculation with an example (TO DO add table). This operationalisation aims at capturing a region’s entire outflow and thus the impact of emigration on the remaining inhabitants. I use the sum of all emigrants from a region between two elections in order to capture the extent of emigration that a voter may perceive. Averaging the population is a means to find a middle value in the same time period, in thic case between two elections. Finally, I divide by the population and multiply by 1000 in order to calculate a region’s rate, thus allowing for comparisons between regions.

#### Electoral Volatility
\label{passage:electoral-volatility} I operationalise electoral volatility by calculating the Pedersen Index [@pedersenElectoralVolatilityWestern1979] for each NUTS region in every election that data are available for. The Pedersen Index provides a value between 0 and 100 representing the electoral volatility from one election to the next. A value of 0 means there is no change in party vote share between elections. A value of 100 means the opposite, that all parties from the previous election lose all vote share in the next election and are replaced with new parties. Using data from @schraffEuropeanNUTSlevelElection2023, I calculate the Pedersen Index using the politicsR package [@denissonsilvaSilvadenissonPoliticsRV02023] in the R programming language. Table \@ref(tab:ro-pedersen-example) shows electoral volatility between the 2008 and 2012 parliamentary elections in an examplary Romanian NUTS3 region.

In the context of calculating the Pedersen Index, it is important to point out how @schraffEuropeanNUTSlevelElection2023 define parties. Each party receives a unique ID based on @doringPartyFactsDatabase2019. However, defining a party as a single entity over time has its caveats [@doringPartyFactsDatabase2019 101]. E.g., how should two merging parties, party dissolutions or party renamings be dealt with? Within the scope of this thesis, I deem the most sensible option to follow the party coding provided by @schraffEuropeanNUTSlevelElection2023. Here an example of how their approach works in practice. Two seperate parties have their own unique IDs, $P_1$ and $P_2$, at election $E_0$. If these two parties then merge to compete together in the next election $E_1$, this will result in a third, new party ID, $P_3$. This new ID is completely detached from the previous two IDs, thus no connection can be made between the IDs $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$. A consequence of this approach is that all three IDs exist for both elections, $E_0$ and $E_1$. However, $P_1$ and $P_2$ have a vote share of zero percent in $E_1$. This is because $P_1$ and $P_2$ did not compete in $E_1$, as they competed together as $P_3$.

A real life example can be observed in Table \@ref(tab:ro-pedersen-example). In Bihor County, Romania, the National Liberal Party (ID: 481) reached 23.83\% of the vote in the 2008 election, the Alliance PSD+PC (ID: 6153) got 17.72\% of the vote. In 2011, these two parties formed the Social Liberal Union (ID: 5941)^[Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberal_Party_(Romania)#Transition_from_USL_to_ACL_and_third_governing_experiences_(2010%E2%80%932020), retrieved 27 January 2024], under which they competed in the 2012 election. Due to this merge, the National Liberal Party and the Alliance PSD+PC have an election result of zero percent in the 2012 election. On the other hand, the Social Liberal Union has zero percent vote share in the 2008 election and 49.25\% vote share in the 2012 election.

Treating party merges this way works if voters consider a new alliance of existing parties to be a novel party. This is however a very charitable assumption and most likely will not hold. In sum, this setup will result in a Pedersen Index that is too high, as parties that merge do not truly lose their entire electoral share from one election to the next. Developing a method to more precisely capture party landscape changes over time would be called for, but this is not feasible within the scope of this thesis. Thus I revert to using the unique party IDs provided by @schraffEuropeanNUTSlevelElection2023.

#### Economic Performance
I operationalise a region’s economic performance using two variables. The first variable is a region’s yearly gross domestic product (GDP) at current markets prices in Euros per inhabitant. These data are provided by Eurostat.^[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nama_10r_3gdp__custom_9030433/default/table?lang=en (retrieved 16 December 2023)] I use the GDP per capita as a general indicator for a region’s economy under the assumption that this value captures the overall economic performance in a way that is comparable across different regions within a country.

The second variable I use to operationalise a region’s economic performance is its unemployment rate, which is provided by the Romanian Statistical Agency.^[Variable SOM103A: Unemployment rate by gender, macroregions, development regions and counties (http://statistici.insse.ro:8077/tempo-online/#/pages/tables/insse-table, retrieved 19 January 2024)] The unemployment rate is a common indicator to judge the incumbent party’s economic performance by, widely recognised and easily understood by voters.

In sum, both variables aim at capturing the overall economic mood that the electorate perceives and judges incumbent parties by when casting their vote.
