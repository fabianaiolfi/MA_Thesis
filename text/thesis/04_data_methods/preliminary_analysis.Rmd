### Preliminary Analysis

In order to test the three hypotheses, three assumptions must hold first. One, does a countryâ€™s accession to the EU affect external emigration? Two, does external emigration affect service cuts? And finally three, does external emigration affect incumbent vote share?

```{r, child = 'preliminary_analysis_accession_emigration.Rmd'}
```

```{r, child = 'preliminary_analysis_emigration_service_cuts.Rmd'}
```

<!-- ```{r, child = 'xxx.Rmd'} -->
<!-- # Does emigration cause grievances? -->
<!-- ``` -->

```{r, child = 'preliminary_analysis_emigration_incumbent_vote_share.Rmd'}
```
