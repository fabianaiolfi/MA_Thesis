### Preliminary Analysis

In order to test the three hypotheses, three assumptions must hold first. One, does a countryâ€™s accession to the EU affect external emigration? Two, does external emigration affect service cuts? And finally three, does external emigration affect incumbent vote share?

```{r, child = 'preliminary_analysis_accession_emigration.Rmd'}
```

```{r, child = 'preliminary_analysis_emigration_service_cuts.Rmd'}
```

```{r, child = 'preliminary_analysis_emigration_incumbent_vote_share.Rmd'}
```

Based on these preliminary results, I proceed by testing the hypotheses on Romania, as these data all point toward supporting the theoretical assumptions. I discard Poland from this point onwards, as external emigration displays no effect on incumbent support.
