## Abstract

This thesis investigates the political consequences of high emigration rates in Central and Eastern European EU countries, where the EU’s Freedom of Movement (FoM) accelerates out-migration. Existing research shows that emigration leads to service cuts in affected regions. This decrease in service quality, in turn, impacts the electorate’s voting behaviour. This thesis aims to identify specific service cuts caused by emigration that subsequently change voting behaviour, specifically incumbent support. The cuts under examination include closures of primary schools, hospitals, and "third places," such as bars and cafés. An association between these service cuts and incumbent support is measured in subnational regions in Poland and Romania between 2005 and 2019. Two-way fixed effects linear regression models aim to assess a relationship between changes in the availability of services per capita and shifts in incumbent support. Results do not display a clear association. However, there is some evidence that emigration-induced primary school closures correlate with a decrease in incumbent support in Romanian subnational NUTS3 regions.
