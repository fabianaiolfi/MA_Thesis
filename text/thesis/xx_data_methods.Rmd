## Data and Methods

### Overview of available data, how it was collected and transformed
Data on service cuts at regional levels are provided by national statistical offices.

The Polish government agency “Statistics Poland”^[https://bdl.stat.gov.pl/bdl/start, retrieved 20 November 2023] provides data on the number of primary schools at NUTS2 level^[Subgroup P1781: Primary schools for children, youth, and adults, by governing authority (https://bdl.stat.gov.pl/bdl/dane/podgrup/tablica, retrieved 20 November 2023)] and the size of the primary school population^[Subgroup P1341: Population by singular age and sex (https://bdl.stat.gov.pl/bdl/dane/podgrup/tablica, retrieved 20 November 2023)].

“Statistics Poland” also provides NUTS2 level data on the number of hospitals ^[Subgroup P2452: General hospitals (https://bdl.stat.gov.pl/bdl/dane/podgrup/tablica. retrieved 24 November 2023)] as well as the number of third places. ^[Subgroup P2505: Number of catering estabilishments [sic] (https://bdl.stat.gov.pl/bdl/dane/podgrup/tablica, retrieved 27 November 2023)]






- Inexplicable decrease in Romanian schools in early 2000s, potential use of number of classrooms as a proxy

- Data on external emigration provided by national statistical offices. I use the sum of people moving abroad from a NUTS region in a year. 
- I choose this value because I argue it carries more validity when it comes to measuring the impact of emigration than, e.g., net migration, which uses the difference between immigration and emigraiton.


- Preliminary Analysis
	- Does EU accession affect emigration?
	- Does emigration cause service cuts?
	- Does emigration cause grievances?
	- Does emigration affect incumbent vote share?
- Defining incumbent party: Under what circumstances are parties defined as incumbent in the context of this thesis?
- Operationalising DV and IV
	- Service Cuts: Ratio of target audience to institutions, e.g., number of school children per school, and its average change between two elections
	- Incumbent vote change between national parliamentary elections
- Selecting Poland and Romania as typical CEE EU member states with high emigration rates
- Models: Mediation analysis, interactions and fixed effects
	- Empirical specification based on operationalised variables
	- Control variables: Emigration rate (based on Dancygier et al., 2022, 17), electoral volatility, GDP, grievances
