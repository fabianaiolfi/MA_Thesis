Based on the outcomes of Model Specifications A and B, I evaluate the hypotheses to determine whether they should be rejected or not rejected.

It is evident that in the case of Romania all three hypotheses put forward must be rejected. I draw this conclusion from the fact that none of the model outcomes demonstrate statistical significance below the conventional threshold of $p = 0.1$. However, two results do exhibit borderline significance. The service cuts to schools in Model Specification A (Models 1 and 2 in Table \@ref(tab:results-emigration-incumbent-vote-share)) and in Model Specification B (Model 1 in Table \@ref(tab:results-emigration-incumbent-vote-share-control-interaction)).

This hints at a potential association between emigration induced school closures and a decrease in incumbent support, both as an isolated effect (Model Specification A) and as a conditioning effect (Model Specification B). But in order to confirm the validity and robustness of this finding and thus to be able to not reject Hypothesis 1, more data is needed.

In short, the lack of a clear statistical significance in the current results underscore the necessity for further investigation and data collection. This would help build a model that can clearly fail to reject the hypotheses put forward.

<!-- Discussion of further results -->
School closings aside, I briefly discuss the results around hospital and third places closures. We can observe practically no effect of service cuts to hospitals on incumbent support. This may be due to the fact that there are few hospitals in most Romanian NUTS3 regions and their numbers remain steady over time (TO DO see Figure in Appendix; take note of the values on the y-axis and that this variation is relatively small). This lack of variation over time could explain why hospital service cuts display no effect.

Finally, I look at the closures of third places being positively associated with incumbent vote share change. These results may hint at a more complex mechanism. E.g., if there are more people per third place, this may result in a stronger feeling of community, from which incumbents could profit. However, this is speculative and merits more examination.

TO DO: explain why hypotheses are rejected, ie why lack of statistical power; there are many factors that influence incumbent support
