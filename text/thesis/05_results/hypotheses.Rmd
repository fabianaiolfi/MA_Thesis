Based on the outcomes of Model Specifications A and B, I evaluate the hypotheses to determine whether they should be rejected or not rejected.

It is evident that in the case of Romania all three hypotheses put forward must be rejected. I draw this conclusion from the fact that none of the model outcomes demonstrate statistical significance below the conventional threshold of $p = 0.1$. However, two results do exhibit borderline significance. The service cuts to schools in Model Specification A (Model 1 in Table \@ref(tab:results-emigration-incumbent-vote-share)) and in Model Specification B (Model 1 in Table \@ref(tab:results-emigration-incumbent-vote-share-control-interaction)).

This hints at a potential association between emigration induced school closures and a decrease in incumbent support, both as an isolated effect (Model Specification A) and as a conditioning effect (Model Specification B). But in order to confirm the validity and robustness of this finding and thus to be able to not reject Hypothesis 1, more observations are needed. Also, the sudden drop in the number of Romanian primary schools at the beginning of the 2000s^[See Figure \ref{fig:ro-primary-schools} in the appendix] should be specifically examined, as this drop increases the number of children per school, thus directly affecting the model’s independent variable.

<!-- Discussion of further results: Hospitals -->
When looking at results around hospital closures, we can observe no effect on incumbent support. There are several feasible explanations for this, first and foremost the possibility that voters do not associate hospital closures with incumbent parties. This may be due to hospitals being more strongly associated with local authorities than with incumbent government parties on the national level. 

Furthermore, when looking at the ratio of people per hospital,^[See Figure \ref{fig:ro-hospital-ratio} in the appendix] we cannot distinguish a general trend across NUTS regions. E.g., RO212 sees a two-fold increase in the number of people per hospital between 2000 and 2019, while RO411 sees this ratio cut in half in the same time period. The variation between regions differs too, such as RO112 displaying very little and RO322 a lot of variation. This lack of a clear pattern in the data can also contribute to no discernible effect appearing in the results.

<!-- Discussion of further results: Third Places -->
Finally, I look at the closures of third places being positively associated with incumbent vote share change in Romania across all results. This positive association may stem from the general increase of people per third place in a majority of Romanian NUTS3 regions.^[See Figure \ref{fig:ro-third-places-ratio} in the appendix] The model results may indicate that closing down bars and cafés is received differently by the electorate than school or hospital closures. An increase in people per third place may not impede service quality to the same extent as, e.g., an increase in people per hospital. There may even be an opposite effect, whereby a higher number of people per third place results in a stronger feeling of community, thus benefitting incumbents. However, this is speculative and merits more examination.

These results indicate that incumbent support is a complex matter, influenced by a variety of factors that the models in this thesis do not take into account. In sum, the lack of a clear statistical significance in the current results underscore the necessity for further investigation and data collection. This would help build a model that can clearly fail to reject the hypotheses put forward.
