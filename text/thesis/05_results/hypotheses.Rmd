Based on the results of Model Specifications A and B, I turn to the hypotheses set up earlier and assess if they can be rejected or if I fail to reject them. It is evident that in the case of Romania all three hypotheses put forward must be rejected. I draw this conclusion from the fact that none of the model outcomes demonstrate statistical significance below the conventional threshold of $p = 0.1$. However, two results do exhibit borderline significance. The service cuts to schools in Model Specification A (Models 1 and 2 in Table \@ref(tab:results-emigration-incumbent-vote-share)) and in Model Specification B (Model 1 in Table \@ref(tab:results-emigration-incumbent-vote-share-control-interaction)). This hints at a potential trend of emigration induced school closures and their effect on incumbent support, both as an isolated effect (Model Specification A) and as a conditioning effect (Model Specification B). But in order to confirm the validity and robustness of this finding and thus to be able to not reject Hypothesis 1, more data is needed.

In short, the lack of a clear statistical significance in the current results underscore the necessity for further investigation and data collection. This would help build a model that can clearly fail to reject the hypotheses put forward.

<!-- Discussion of further results -->
After looking at school closures as service cuts, I turn to hospital closures. We can observe practically no effect of less hospitals on incumbent vote share change. This may be due to the fact that most Romanian NUTS3 regions only contain a few hospitals and their numbers are steady over time (TO DO see Figure in Appendix; take note of the values on the y-axis and that this variation is relatively small). This lack of variation over time could explain why this service cut displays no effect.

Finally, I look at the closures of third places having being positively associated with incumbent vote share change. These results may hint at a more complex mechanism. E.g., if there are more people per third place, this may result in a stronger feeling of community, from which incumbents could profit again. However, this is speculative and merits more examination.
